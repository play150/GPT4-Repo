The basic methodology of an in vitro meat production system (IMPS) involves culturing muscle tissue in a liquid medium on a large scale. Each component of the system offers an array of options which are described taking into account recent advances in relevant research. A major advantage of an IMPS is that the conditions are controlled and manipulatable. Limitations discussed include meeting nutritional requirements and large scale operation. The direction of further research and prospects regarding the future of in vitro meat production will be speculated. Industrial relevance The development of an alternative meat production system is driven by the growing demand for meat and the shrinking resources available to produce it by current methods. Implementation of an in vitro meat production system (IMPS) to complement existing meat production practices creates the opportunity for meat products of different characteristics to be put onto the market. In vitro produced meat products resembling the processed and comminuted meat products of today will be sooner to develop than those resembling traditional cuts of meat.

The alkaline phosphatase-positive colonies resulting from reprogramming resemble mouse embryonic stem cells in colony morphology, cell cycle interval, transcriptome profile, and expression of pluripotent markers, such as POU5F1, SOX2, and surface marker SSEA1. They are dependent on leukemia inhibitory factor signaling for maintenance of pluripotency, can be cultured over extended passage, and have the ability to form teratomas. These cells derived from the inner cell mass of pig blastocysts are clearly distinct from the FGF2-dependent ""primed"" induced pluripotent stem cells described recently from porcine mesenchymal cells. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that the up-regulation of KLF4, as well as POU5F1, is required to create and stabilize the naive pluripotent state and may explain why the derivation of embryonic stem cells from pigs and other ungulates has proved so difficult.",,Cultivated Meat Library,,pES(O2K),,Sus scrofa,,2011,286,33,28948-28953,J.

This ability makes them extremely valuable for research. They also hold substantial promise for medical applications, since they can be used to replace cells lost or damaged by disease or injury. Embryos represent a rich source of stem cells; however, obtaining these cells from human embryos raises obvious ethical and practical concerns, and they have also been difficult to isolate from many species. A recent discovery circumvented these issues for humans and several mammalian species commonly studied in the laboratory. This technique can turn cells from adult mammals into ‘induced pluripotent stem cells’, or iPSCs, by switching on four genes. Nevertheless, no analogous method has yet been established to create similar cell populations in non-mammalian organisms, which are also important models for human development and disease. Now, Rosselló et al. have shown that cells from both invertebrate and non-mammalian vertebrate species—including birds, fish and insects—can be reprogrammed into cells that closely resemble iPSCs. Intriguingly, these cells were created by switching on the same four genes that generate iPSCs in mammals, even though vertebrates and invertebrates are separated by around 550 million years of evolution. Rosselló et al. used a viral vector that carries the four stem-cell genes (from the mouse) into target cells from the different species. The genetically altered cells developed into iPSC-like cells with many of the characteristics of natural mammalian and bird stem cells. To confirm that the cells were pluripotent, Rossello et al. first showed that the cells could develop into primitive early embryos called embryoid bodies. For the vertebrate species tested, the embryoid bodies contained cells from each of the three main vertebrate embryo cell types. Secondly, iPSC-like cells from two organisms—chicks and zebrafish—formed various mature cell types when injected into developing chick or zebrafish embryos. These results have two important implications. They suggest that the genetic mechanisms by which cells can be reprogrammed into a stem-like state have been conserved through 550 million years of evolution; additionally, they demonstrate that stem-like cells can be generated from important experimental organisms, and provide an important tool for both biological and biomedical research.",iPS; quail; zebra finch; Drosophila,"Deep dive: Cultivated meat cell lines,Cultivated Meat Library",,,,"Danio rerio,Coturnix coturnix,Gallus gallus",,2013,2,,e00036,eLife Sciences,eLife Sciences Publications Limited,2013-09-03,,2050-084X,,10.7554/eLife.00036,,,,,en,,,,,,,,,,,2021-07-23,2022-08-26

Vegetarians and vegans who embrace cultured meat emphasize how it could contribute to the diminishment of animal suffering and exploitation, while in a more mainstream profile cultured meat helps to keep meat eating sustainable and affordable. In this paper we argue that these profiles do not exhaust the options and that (gut) feelings as well as imagination are needed to explore possible future options. On the basis of workshops, we present a third moral profile, “the pig in the backyard”. Here cultured meat is imagined as an element of a hybrid community of humans and animals that would allow for both the consumption of animal protein and meaningful relations with domestic (farm) animals. Experience in the workshops and elsewhere also illustrates that thinking about cultured meat inspires new thoughts on “normal” meat. In short, the idea of cultured meat opens up new search space in various ways. We suggest that ethics can take an active part in these searches, by fostering a process that integrates (gut) feelings, imagination and rational thought and that expands the range of our moral identities.",,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2013,3,3,647-662,Animals,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,2013-07-26,,,,10.3390/ani3030647,,,,"Wageningen University, P.O.

The paper also presents insights from a primary exploratory study performed in April 2013 with consumers from Flanders (Belgium) (n=180). The concept of cultured meat was only known (unaided) by 13% of the study participants. After receiving basic information about what cultured meat is, participants expressed favorable expectations about the concept. Only 9% rejected the idea of trying cultured meat, while two thirds hesitated and about quarter indicated to be willing to try it. The provision of additional information about the environmental benefits of cultured meat compared to traditional meat resulted in 43% of the participants indicating to be willing to try this novel food, while another 51% indicated to be ‘maybe’ willing to do so. Price and sensory expectations emerged as major obstacles. Consumers eating mostly vegetarian meals were less convinced that cultured meat might be healthy, suggesting that vegetarians may not be the ideal primary target group for this novel meat substitute.

Methods to produce in vitro meat generally involve the growth of muscle cells that are cultured on scaffolds using bioreactors. Suitable scaffold design and manufacture are critical to downstream culture and meat production. Most current scaffolds are based on mammalian-derived biomaterials, the use of which is counter to the desire to obviate mammal slaughter in artificial meat production. Consequently, most of the knowledge is related to the design and control of scaffold properties based on these mammalian-sourced materials. To address this, four different scaffold materials were formulated using non-mammalian sources, namely, salmon gelatin, alginate, and additives including gelling agents and plasticizers. The scaffolds were produced using a freeze-drying process, and the physical, mechanical, and biological properties of the scaffolds were evaluated. The most promising scaffolds were produced from salmon gelatin, alginate, agarose, and glycerol, which exhibited relatively large pore sizes (~200 μm diameter) and biocompatibility, permitting myoblast cell adhesion (~40%) and growth (~24 h duplication time). The biodegradation profiles of the scaffolds were followed, and were observed to be less than 25% after 4 weeks. The scaffolds enabled suitable myogenic response, with high cell proliferation, viability, and adequate cell distribution throughout.

The GSK3B inhibitor, CHIR99021 was employed to suppress apoptosis, elicit WNT signaling events and drive naïve-type piPSC along the mesoderm lineage, and, in combination with the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-aza-cytidine, to activate an early skeletal muscle transcription program. Terminal differentiation was then induced by activation of an ectopically expressed MYOD1. Myotubes, characterized by myofibril development and both spontaneous and stimuli-elicited excitation-contraction coupling cycles appeared within 11 days. Efficient lineage-specific differentiation was confirmed by uniform NCAM1 and myosin heavy chain expression.

Cultured meat forms part of the emerging field of cellular agriculture. Still an early stage field it seeks to deliver products traditionally made through livestock rearing in novel forms that require no, or significantly reduced, animal involvement. Key examples include cultured meat, milk, egg white and leather. Here, we focus upon cultured meat and its technical, socio-political and regulatory challenges and opportunities.

Scope and approach
The paper reports the thinking of an interdisciplinary team, all of whom have been active in the field for a number of years. It draws heavily upon the published literature, as well as our own professional experience. This includes ongoing laboratory work to produce cultured meat and over seventy interviews with experts in the area conducted in the social science work.

Key findings and conclusions
Cultured meat is a promising, but early stage, technology with key technical challenges including cell source, culture media, mimicking the in-vivo myogenesis environment, animal-derived and synthetic materials, and bioprocessing for commercial-scale production. Analysis of the social context has too readily been reduced to ethics and consumer acceptance, and whilst these are key issues, the importance of the political and institutional forms a cultured meat industry might take must also be recognised, and how ambiguities shape any emergent regulatory system.",,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2018,78,,155-166,Trends Food Sci.

Livestock in particular is a major environmental stressor [1] as it produces an estimated 15% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions [2], which is more than the whole transportation sector. The main sources of these emissions are methane from ruminants' enteric fermentation, emissions related to feed production, manure management and use of energy. In addition, cutting down forests for pasture and feed production substantially contributes to carbon dioxide emissions and biodiversity loss, especially in tropical regions. Livestock production also releases nitrogen and phosphorus into waterways, which causes eutrophication, disturbs ecosystems and can even result in oxygen depletion in lakes and oceans with drastic consequences for fish and other aquatic species. Lastly, livestock production consumes around a quarter of all fresh water available. > Population growth and rising average incomes mean that the global demand for livestock products will further increase by up to 70% between 2010 and 2050… Population growth and rising average incomes mean that the global demand for livestock products will further increase by up to 70% between 2010 and 2050 [2], which will have dramatic environmental consequences. However, the possibilities for increasing livestock production without increasing its environmental impact are very limited. Intensive livestock systems may help to use resources more efficiently and to better control emissions, but it has negative effects on animal welfare owing to limited space and cramped living conditions. > Cultured meat has often been heralded as a silver bullet for solving the environmental problems caused by livestock production.

Participants (n = 775) read a passage about either nutritionally enhanced or nutritionally equivalent cultured meat, and subsequently answered questions about their beliefs, attitudes, and behavioural intentions towards cultured meat. Those in the nutritionally enhanced condition rated cultured meat as significantly healthier, more able to prevent diseases associated with meat consumption, and more likely to have benefits for society. However, they also rated cultured meat as significantly less similar to conventional meat in terms of sensory attributes including taste. This latter difference may have been caused by additional messages about taste similarity in the nutritionally equivalent condition. Overall, there was no significant difference in ratings of naturalness, overall attitudes, or purchase intent. We also found further evidence to support the existence of a large base of consumers interested in cultured meat in the US, and the higher appeal of cultured meat to liberals, meat-eaters, and those who are more familiar with the concept. The results suggest that cultured meat producers which opt to make nutritional enhancements to their products should take extra care to address consumer concerns about the possible impact on product taste, since research shows taste to be a stronger predictor of food choice than healthiness.

In the last decade, scientists have begun to leverage the knowledge and tools accumulated in the fields of stem cells and tissue engineering toward the development of cell-based meat (i.e., clean meat). In tissue engineering, the physical and biochemical features of the native tissue can be mimicked; cells and biomaterials are integrated under suitable culture conditions to form mature tissues. More specifically, in skeletal muscle tissue engineering, a plurality of cell types can be co-cultured on a 3D scaffold to generate muscle fibers, blood vessels and a dense extracellular matrix (ECM). This review focuses on tissue engineering of skeletal muscle and the adjustments needed for clean meat development. We discuss the skeletal muscle structure and composition, and elaborate on cell types from farm animals that have the potential to recapitulate the muscle ECM, blood vessels, muscle fibers and fat deposits. We also review relevant biomaterials, primarily for fabricating scaffolds that can mimic the intramuscular connective tissues, as well as gene expression studies on the biological pathways that influence meat quality.

Some evidence suggests that acceptance of clean meat will vary substantially across cultures, though there is currently a lack of quantitative research in Asia and country comparisons on this topic. Both are likely to be important areas given the forecasted increase in meat consumption in developing countries. Participants (n = 3,030) were recruited through the research panel CINT to take an online questionnaire about clean meat and plant-based meat. The participants were representative of China, India, and the U.S. in terms of age and gender, though participants in India and China were disproportionately urban, high income, and well educated. As well as clean meat, participants were asked about plant-based meat, a conceptually similar product with similar potential to displace demand for conventional meat. They also answered the Meat Attachment Questionnaire and the Food Neophobia Scale. We compared these variables between countries, and used regression models to identify which demographic and attitudinal factors predicted purchase intent towards both products. We found significantly higher acceptance of clean and plant-based meat in India and China compared to the USA. We also found significantly higher food neophobia and significantly lower meat attachment in India compared to China and the USA. We identified several demographic patterns of clean and plant-based meat acceptance, as well as which beliefs were important predictors of acceptance within each country. In particular, higher familiarity predicted higher acceptance of plant-based and clean meat across all countries.

Comparisons with beef are typically highlighted, as it is a highly emissions intensive food product. In this study we present a more rigorous comparison of the potential climate impacts of cultured meat and cattle production than has previously been made. Warming impacts are evaluated using a simple climate model that simulates the different behaviours of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), rather than relying on carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) metrics. We compare the temperature impact of beef cattle and cultured meat production at all times to 1000 years in the future, using four synthetic meat GHG footprints currently available in the literature and three different beef production systems studied in an earlier climate modelling paper. Cattle systems are associated with the production of all three GHGs above, including significant emissions of CH4, while cultured meat emissions are almost entirely CO2 from energy generation. Under continuous high global consumption, cultured meat results in less warming than cattle initially, but this gap narrows in the long term and in some cases cattle production causes far less warming, as CH4 emissions do not accumulate, unlike CO2. We then model a decline in meat consumption to more sustainable levels following high consumption, and show that although cattle systems generally result in greater peak warming than cultured meat, the warming effect declines and stabilises under the new emission rates of cattle systems, while the CO2 based warming from cultured meat persists and accumulates even under reduced consumption, again overtaking cattle production in some scenarios. We conclude that cultured meat is not prima facie climatically superior to cattle production; its relative impact instead depends on the availability of decarbonised energy generation and the specific production systems that are realised.",,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,Bos taurus,,2019,3,,5,Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems,,2019,,2571-581X,,10.3389/fsufs.2019.00005,,,,"Atmospheric, Oceanic, and Planetary Physics, Department of Physics, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom",,,,,,,,,,,,2021-07-23,2022-08-26

As gelatin is a natural component of meat, resulting from collagen denaturation during processing and cooking, our extruded gelatin microfibers recapitulated structural and biochemical features of natural muscle tissues. Using immersion rotary jet spinning, a dry-jet wet-spinning process, we produced gelatin fibers at high rates (~ 100 g/h, dry weight) and, depending on process conditions, we tuned fiber diameters between ~ 1.3 ± 0.1 μm (mean ± SEM) and 8.7 ± 1.4 μm (mean ± SEM), which are comparable to natural collagen fibers.

The history of GMOs suggests at least eleven concrete lessons for cultured meat adoption that remain under-discussed in the literature. This paper's findings diverge in several ways from received wisdom on cultured meat adoption. We argue, among other things, that genetic engineering firms understood their work to be humanitarian and environmentally-friendly and so were unprepared for popular backlash, that technology adoption is more readily affected by consumer activism when buyers in a supply chain exert more pressure on sellers than the reverse, and that focusing on the positive aspects of a technology is more successful for encouraging its adoption than responding to negative perceptions.",,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2019,,,104408,Appetite,,2019-08-23,,0195-6663,1095-8304,10.1016/j.appet.2019.104408,31449883,,,"Department of Political Science, The City University of New York, Lehman College, Carman Hall 364, 250 Bedford Park Blvd. West, Bronx, NY, 10468, USA.

More recently, cultured cells have been used as the cell source of ""cultured meat."" Cell cultivation requires media containing nutrients, of which glucose and amino acids are the essential ones. These nutrients are generally derived from grains or heterotrophic microorganisms, which also require various nutrients derived from grains. Grain culture, in turn, requires many chemical fertilizers and agrochemicals, which can cause greenhouse gas emission and environmental contamination. Furthermore, grain production is greatly influenced by environmental changes. In contrast, microalgae efficiently synthesize various nutrients using solar energy, water, and inorganic substances, which are widely used in the energy sector. In this study, we aimed to apply nutrients extracted from microalgae in the culture media for mammalian cell cultivation. Glucose was efficiently extracted from Chlorococcum littorale or Arthrospira platensis using sulfuric acid, whereas 18 of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids were efficiently extracted from Chlorella vulgaris using hydrochloric acid. We further investigated whether nutrients present in the algal extracts could be used in mammalian cell cultivation. Although almost all C2C12 mouse myoblasts died during cultivation in a glucose- and amino acid-free medium, the cell death was rescued by adding algal extract(s) into the nutrient-deficient media. This indicates that nutrients present in algal extracts can be used for mammalian cell cultivation.

The sensor’s working principle is based on the phase shift measurement of the two signals, the referent one that is guided through conventional microstrip line and measurement signal guided through the CLRH line. At the operating frequency of 1.275 GHz, the CLRH line supports electromagnetic waves with group and phase velocities that are antiparallel, and therefore the phase “advance” occurs in the case of CLRH line, while phase delay arises in the right-handed (RH) frequency band. The change of the fluid’s properties that flow in the microfluidic reservoir causes the change of effective permittivity of the microstrip substrate, and subsequently the phase velocity changes, as well as the phase shift. This effect was used in the design of the microfluidic sensor for the measurement of characteristics of the fluid that flows in the microfluidic reservoir placed under the CLRH line. The complete measurement system was developed including the Wilkinson power divider that splits the signal between conventional RH and CLRH section, transmission lines with the microfluidic reservoirs, and a detection circuit for phase shift measurement. Measurement results for different fluids confirm that the proposed sensor is characterized by relatively high sensitivity and good linearity (R2 = 0.94). In this study, the practical application of the proposed sensor is demonstrated for the biomass estimation inside the microfluidic bioreactors, which are used for the cultivation of MRC-5 fibroblasts.",,"Cultivated Meat Library,GFI-funded Research",,,,,,2019,8,12,1475,Electronics,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,2019-12-04,,,,10.3390/electronics8121475,,,,,en,,,,,,,,,,,2021-07-23,2022-04-08

Here, we used a Drosophila muscle cell line to demonstrate the benefits of insect cells relative to those derived from vertebrates. The cells were adapted to serum-free media, transitioned between adherent and suspension cultures, and manipulated with hormones. Furthermore, we analyzed edible scaffolds to support cell adhesion and assayed cellular protein and minerals to evaluate nutrition potential.

Cellular agriculture presents an option, by using cell culture, as opposed to whole animals, to generate foods, including meats, eggs, and dairy products. The cost-effective scale-up of such cultured products requires addressing key constraints in core research areas: (1) cell sources, (2) growth media, (3) scaffolding biomaterials and (4) bioreactor design. Here we summarize work in the area of insect cell cultures as a promising avenue to address some of the needs in the field. Properties unique to invertebrate cells from insects allow for convenient and efficient tissue production and have already been exploited for various applications, such as industrial recombinant protein production. Insect muscle has also been employed in the field of tissue engineering for bioactuator applications. Compared to mammalian or avian cultures, invertebrate cell cultures require fewer resources and are more resilient to changes in environmental conditions, as they can thrive in a wide range of temperature, pH and osmolarity conditions. Alterations necessary for large-scale production are relatively simple to achieve with insect cells, including immortalization, serum-free media adaptation and suspension culture. Additional benefits include ease of transfection, nutrient density, and relevance to seafood organisms. To advance insect-based tissue engineering for food purposes, it is necessary to develop methods to regulate the differentiation of insect cells into relevant cell types, characterize cell interactions with biomaterials with an eye towards 3D culture, design supportive bioreactor systems and quantify nutritional profiles of cultured biomass.",,"Cultivated Meat Library,Deep dive: Cultivated meat cell culture media part A",,,,,,2019,3,,24,Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems,,2019,,2571-581X,,10.3389/fsufs.2019.00024,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-07-23,2021-11-10

With growing interest in cellular agriculture as a means to address public health, environmental, and animal welfare challenges of animal agriculture, the concept of producing seafood from fish cell- and tissue-cultures is emerging as an approach to address similar challenges with industrial aquaculture systems and marine capture. Cell-based seafood—as opposed to animal-based seafood—can combine developments in biomedical engineering with modern aquaculture techniques. Biomedical engineering developments such as closed-system bioreactor production of land animal cells create a basis for the large scale production of marine animal cells. Aquaculture techniques such as genetic modification and closed system aquaculture have achieved significant gains in production that can pave the way for innovations in cell-based seafood production. Here, we present the current state of innovation relevant to the development of cell-based seafood across multiple species, as well as specific opportunities and challenges that exist for advancing this science. The authors find that the physiological properties of fish cell- and tissue- culture may be uniquely suited to cultivation in vitro. These physiological properties, including tolerance to hypoxia, high buffering capacity, and low-temperature growth conditions, make marine cell culture an attractive opportunity for scaled production of cell-based seafood; perhaps even more so than mammalian and avian cell cultures for cell-based meats. This opportunity, coupled with the unique capabilities of crustacean tissue-friendly scaffolding such as chitosan, a common seafood waste product and mushroom derivative, presents promise for cell-based seafood production via bioreactor cultivation. To become fully realized, cell-based seafood research will require more understanding of fish muscle cell and tissue cultivation; more investigation into serum-free media formulations optimized for fish cell culture; and bioreactor designs tuned to the needs of fish cells for large scale production.",,"Cultivated Meat Library,PISCES/ATLAS,Fish-entials,Deep dive: Cultivated meat bioprocess design",CC BY,,,,,2019,3,,43,Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems,,2019,,2571-581X,,10.3389/fsufs.2019.00043,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-04,2023-02-02

Findings Urban consumers were more receptive towards cultured meat and more concerned about the environmental impact of current meat production practices. Rural consumers were more concerned about the possible damaging effect cultured meat production could have on agri-business and the livelihood of Irish farmers. The safety of the technology emerged as the biggest concern for both sets of consumers.

To evaluate whether heme proteins also have a positive effect on cell-based meat production, bovine muscle satellite cells (BSCs) were grown in the presence of hemoglobin (Hb) or myoglobin (Mb) for up to nine days in a fibrin hydrogel along 3D-printed anchor-point constructs to generate bioartificial muscles (BAMs). The influence of heme proteins on cell proliferation, tissue development, and tissue color was analyzed. We found that the proliferation and metabolic activity of BSCs was significantly increased when Mb was added, while Hb had no, or a slightly negative, effect. Hb and, in particular, Mb application led to a very similar color of BAMs compared to cooked beef, which was not noticeable in groups without added heme proteins.

Across this period the field, or as it is now more commonly termed, the ‘space’, has developed significantly while promoting different visions for what CM is and can do, and the best mechanisms for delivery. Here we both analyse and critically engage with this near-twenty year period as a productive provocation to those engaged with CM, or considering becoming so. This paper is not a history of the field, and does not offer a comprehensive timeline. Instead it identifies significant activities, transitions, and moments in which key meanings and practices have taken form or exerted influence. We do this through analysing two related themes: the CM ‘institutional context’ and the CM ‘interpretative package’. The former, the institutional context, refers to events and infrastructures that have come into being to support and shape the CM field, including university activities, conferences, third sector groups, various potential funding mechanisms, and the establishment of a start-up sector. The latter, the interpretative package, refers to the constellation of factors that shape or assert how CM should be understood, including the various names used to describe it, accounts of what it will achieve, and most recently, the emergent regulatory discussions that frame its legal standing . Across the paper we argue it is productive to think of the CM community in terms of a first and second wave. The first wave was more university-based and broadly covers the period from the millennium until around the 2013 cultured burger event. The second wave saw the increasing prevalence of a start-up culture and the circuits of venture capital interest that support it.

Consumer demand for cellular meat production derives principally from concerns over environment and animal welfare, while secondary considerations include consumer and public health aspects of animal production, and food security. The present limitations to cellular meat production include the identification of immortal cell lines, availability of cost-effective, bovine-serum-free growth medium for cell proliferation and maturation, scaffold materials for cell growth, scaling up to an industrial level, regulatory and labelling issues and at what stage mixing of myo-, adipo- and even fibrocytes can potentially occur. Consumer perceptions that cell-based meat production will result in improvements to animal welfare and the environment have been challenged, with the outcome needing to wait until the processes used in cell-based meat are close to a commercial reality. Challenges for cell-based meat products include the simulation of nutritional attributes, texture, flavour and mouthfeel of animal-derived meat products. There is some question over whether consumers will accept the technology, but likely there will be acceptance of cell-based meat products, in particular market segments. Currently, the cost of growth media, industry scale-up of specific components of the cell culture process, intellectual property sharing issues and regulatory hurdles mean that it will likely require an extended period for cellular meat to be consistently available in high-end restaurants and even longer to be available for the mass market. The progress in plant-based meat analogues is already well achieved, with products such as the ImpossibleTM Burger and other products already available. These developments may make the development of cellular meat products obsolete. But the challenges remain of mimicking not only the nutritional attributes, flavour, shape and structure of real meat, but also the changes in regulation and labelling.",animal welfare; consumer; environment; health; lab meat,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2019,,,1-18,Animal,,2019-08-28,,1751-7311,1751-732X,10.1017/S1751731119001897,31456539,,,"School of Agriculture and Food, Faculty of Veterinary and Agricultural Sciences, Parkville, Victoria 3052, Australia.",en,,,,,,,,,,,2021-07-23,2021-11-10

At present, the challenge of cultured meat production is how to efficiently simulate the growth environment of animal muscle tissue and realize large-scale production in bioreactor. Although cell tissue engineering has been deeply studied and achieved varying successful application, it is still difficult to obtain large-scale cultured meat production due to the high cost and technical requirements. Therefore, the development of efficient and safe cell culture technology is an urgent problem for large-scale cultured meat production, which can effectively reduce costs and achieve industrial application.

Cultivated meat is a potentially more sustainable alternative to factory farming that could mitigate water contamination, land use, and disease spread. As a nascent technology, however, a number of challenges must be overcome before cultivated meat is available worldwide. Arguably the most fundamental challenge is the efficient production of biomass at scale.

At present, two significant issues stand in the way of scaling up production. First is the cost of media fed into the bioreactor to support cell growth. Media costs will decline as serum-free media technologies - already in use by some cultivated meat producers - eliminate the need for expensive fetal bovine serum. Further cost reductions are expected as media formulations transition from small quantities and custom combinations used in R&D to the higher volumes and more predictable demand typical of ingredients used in mass production. How much media cost reduction will be achieved through economy of scale though is a subject of debate.

The second impediment to scaling production is the efficacy of the bioreactor equipment itself at high production volumes. Cells require a nutritious, oxygen rich, homogeneous environment. At the same time cells consume some molecules such as cytokines and chemokines in the environment and excrete others. In live animals, vasculature delivers and collects molecules to sustain every cell’s environment. In bioreactors, mixing the fluid acts as a coarse surrogate for vasculature. As bioreactor volume and cell density increases, maintaining a well-mixed environment tends to require faster fluid flow. A faster fluid flow can induce strong shear forces that cause cells to cease proliferating or to die.

Maintaining a favorable molecular environment for cells without subjecting them to excessive shear stress will require innovation in, and optimization of, bioreactor designs and processes. Both innovation and optimization require extensive experimentation. However, building physical prototypes and running experiments are slow and expensive. Virtual prototyping and experimentation through computer simulation promises to accelerate and lower the cost of progress. However, virtual experiments replicating actual bioreactor and biological behaviors are not immediate: we need first to develop predictive models of the bioreactor environment.

Tha main challenge in developing a predictive model of cells growing in a bioreactor is the complexity of the bioreactor environment and cell behavior. Media flow dynamics, forces and mixing of media components needs to be incorporated into the model. Simultaneously, cells growing on microcarriers, consuming nutrients, excreting waste, proliferating and dying introduces an additional layer of complexity. Thus, modeling the resulting system requires an altogether new multiscale methodology accounting for phenomena happening at diverse spatial and temporal scales.",,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2020,,,,,,2020-11-09,,,,10.5281/zenodo.4264611,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-07-23,2021-11-10

The culture media must be serum-free, affordable, contain only food-grade ingredients, be efficient to promote cell growth and available in massive quantities. The commercially available serum substitutes are expensive and not necessarily food-grade. Identifying inexpensive food-safe alternatives to serum is crucial. By-products from food production are available in massive quantities, contain potential factors that can promote growth and are promising ingredients for serum replacement. The main goal of this study was to explore if food-grade by-product materials can be used as growth promoting agents in skeletal muscle cell culture to develop a tailor-made serum free media. Different by-products, including chicken carcass, cod backbone, eggshell membrane, egg white powder and pork plasma were enzymatically or chemically hydrolyzed. The hydrolysates in addition to lyophilized pork plasma and yeast extract were further characterized by size-exclusion chromatography, elemental combustion analysis and degree of hydrolysis. The materials were used as supplement to or replacement of commercial serum and further evaluated for their effect on metabolic activity, cell proliferation and cell cytotoxicity in muscle cells cultured in vitro. Our results indicate that none of the materials were cytotoxic to the skeletal muscle cells. Hydrolysates rich in peptides with approximately 2-15 amino acids in length were shown to improve cell growth and metabolic activity. Of all the materials tested pork plasma hydrolysates and yeast extract were the most promising. Pork plasma hydrolysates increased metabolic activity by 110% and cell proliferation with 48% when cultured in serum-free conditions for 3 days compared with control cells cultured with full serum conditions. Most interestingly, this response was dependent on both material and choice of enzyme used.

Here, we demonstrate the use of textured soy protein—an edible porous protein-based biomaterial—as a novel CBM scaffold that can support cell attachment and proliferation to create a 3D engineered bovine muscle tissue. The media composition was optimized for 3D bovine satellite cell (BSC) proliferation and differentiation by adding myogenic-related growth factors. Myogenesis of several cell combinations was compared, and elevated myogenesis and ECM deposition were shown in co-culture of BSCs with bovine smooth muscle cells and tri-cultures of BSCs, bovine smooth muscle cells and bovine endothelial cells. The expression of proteins associated with ECM gene sets was increased in the co-culture compared with BSC monoculture. Volunteers tasted the product after cooking and noted its meaty flavour and sensorial attributes, achieving the goal of replicating the sensation and texture of a meat bite.

In 2013, the world's first laboratory grown hamburger made from cultured muscle cells was developed. However, coming at a price of $300.000, and being produced manually, substantial effort is still required to reach sustainable large-scale production. One of the main challenges is scalability. Microcarriers (MCs), offering a large surface/volume ratio, are the most promising candidates for upscaling muscle cell culture. However, although many MCs have been developed for cell lines and stem cells typically used in the medical field, none have been specifically developed for muscle stem cells and meat production. This paper aims to discuss the MCs' design criteria for skeletal muscle cell proliferation and subsequently for meat production based on three scenarios: (1) MCs are serving only as a temporary substrate for cell attachment and proliferation and therefore they need to be separated from the cells at some stage of the bioprocess, (2) MCs serve as a temporary substrate for cell proliferation but are degraded or dissolved during the bioprocess, and (3) MCs are embedded in the final product and therefore need to be edible. The particularities of each of these three bioprocesses will be discussed from the perspective of MCs as well as the feasibility of a one-step bioprocess. Each scenario presents advantages and drawbacks, which are discussed in detail, nevertheless the third scenario appears to be the most promising one for a production process. Indeed, using an edible material can limit or completely eliminate dissociation/degradation/separation steps and even promote organoleptic qualities when embedded in the final product. Edible microcarriers could also be used as a temporary substrate similarly to scenarios 1 and 2, which would limit the risk of non-edible residues.",Microcarriers,"Cultivated Meat Library,Deep dive: Cultivated meat scaffolding part A",,,,,,2020,7,,10,Frontiers in Nutrition,,2020,,2296-861X,,10.3389/fnut.2020.00010,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-07-23,2021-11-10

Although extensively studied and characterized in human and murine models, iPSCs from animals other than mice lack reproducible results. METHODS: Herein, we describe the generation of robust iPSCs from equine and bovine cells through lentiviral transduction of murine or human transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc and from human and murine cells using similar protocols, even when different supplementations were used. The iPSCs were analyzed regarding morphology, gene and protein expression of pluripotency factors, alkaline phosphatase detection, and spontaneous and induced differentiation. RESULTS: Although embryonic-derived stem cells are yet not well characterized in domestic animals, generation of iPS cells from these species is possible through similar protocols used for mouse or human cells, enabling the use of pluripotent cells from large animals for basic or applied purposes. Herein, we also infer that bovine iPS (biPSCs) exhibit similarity to mouse iPSCs (miPSCs), whereas equine iPSs (eiPSCs) to human (hiPSCs).

We find that, whilst rates of vegetarianism were relatively low in France, unrestricted meat-eaters were a minority in Germany, and concern for animal welfare was the most common reason given for meat reduction. Substantial markets for cultured meat exist in both countries, although German consumers are significantly more open to the concept than the French. Strikingly, cultured meat acceptance is significantly higher amongst agricultural and meat workers, indicating that those who are closest to existing meat production methods are most likely to prefer alternatives. We found some evidence that pro-cultured meat messages, which focus on antibiotic resistance and food safety, are significantly more persuasive than those that focus on animals or the environment. Furthermore, consumers project that they would be significantly more likely to consume cultured meat that does not contain genetically modified ingredients. Overall, we find substantially large markets for cultured meat in Germany and France, and identify some potential ways to further increase acceptance in these markets. We conclude by highlighting the most promising markets for cultured meat, and highlighting a lack of antibiotics as a potentially persuasive message about cultured meat.",Europe; attitudes; consumer behaviour; cultured meat; meat alternatives,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2020,9,9,,Foods,,2020-08-21,,2304-8158,,10.3390/foods9091152,32825592,,,"Department of Psychology, University of Bath, Bath BA2 7AY, UK.

A challenged faced by traditional cell culture approaches is that the majority of two-dimensional substrates fail to induce a controlled alignment of cells in vitro. To address this challenge, approaches utilizing mechanical stresses, exposure to electrical fields, structurally aligned biomaterials and/or textured microfabricated substrates, have been developed to control the organization of cells through microenvironmental stimuli. In the field of muscle tissue engineering it is often desirable to control the alignment and fusion of muscle precursor cells as it more closely resembles in vivo conditions. In this study, we utilize plant-derived cellulose biomaterials to control the in vitro alignment of C2C12 murine myoblasts. We hereby report that cells display a clear sensitivity to the highly aligned vascular bundle architectures found in decellularized celery (Apium graveolens). Conveniently, the xylem and phloem channels lie within the 10-100μm diameter, which has been shown to be optimal diameter for myoblast alignment through contact guidance. Following 10 days in proliferation media, F-actin filaments were observed to be aligned parallel to the longitudinal axis of the vascular bundle. Subsequently, following 5 days in differentiation media, myoblast maintained an aligned morphology, which led to the formation of aligned myotubes. We therefore conclude that the microtopography of the vascular bundle guides muscle cell alignment. The results presented here highlight the potential of this plant-derived scaffold for in vitro studies of muscle myogenesis, where structural anisotropy is required to more closely resemble in vivo conditions.",,"Cultivated Meat Library,Deep dive: Cultivated meat scaffolding part A,Deep dive: Cultivated meat scaffolding part B",,,C2C12,,,2020,,,2020.02.23.958686,,,2020-02-24,,,,10.1101/2020.02.23.958686,,,,,en,,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,2021-07-23,2023-02-10

A knowledge mapping using VOSviewer was used to study the literature in the field. Based on Factiva, 12,900 press articles dealing with artificial meat, mainly in English, have been found through public databases. The main conclusion is that cultured meat is mainly developing in the USA and the UK, with other countries, such as China, observing the trend for potential future applications. Scientific articles seemed initially to focus mainly on technical aspects of artificial meat and more recently on health value, consumer's acceptance, and sustainability.

This review aims to update the current knowledge on this subject by focusing on recent publications and issues not well described previously. The main conclusion is that no major advances were observed despite many new publications. Indeed, in terms of technical issues, research is still required to optimize cell culture methodology. It is also almost impossible to reproduce the diversity of meats derived from various species, breeds and cuts. Although these are not yet known, we speculated on the potential health benefits and drawbacks of cultured meat. Unlike conventional meat, cultured muscle cells may be safer, without any adjacent digestive organs. On the other hand, with this high level of cell multiplication, some dysregulation is likely as happens in cancer cells. Likewise, the control of its nutritional composition is still unclear, especially for micronutrients and iron. Regarding environmental issues, the potential advantages of cultured meat for greenhouse gas emissions are a matter of controversy, although less land will be used compared to livestock, ruminants in particular. However, more criteria need to be taken into account for a comparison with current meat production. Cultured meat will have to compete with other meat substitutes, especially plant-based alternatives. Consumer acceptance will be strongly influenced by many factors and consumers seem to dislike unnatural food. Ethically, cultured meat aims to use considerably fewer animals than conventional livestock farming. However, some animals will still have to be reared to harvest cells for the production of in vitro meat. Finally, we discussed in this review the nebulous status of cultured meat from a religious point of view. Indeed, religious authorities are still debating the question of whether in vitro meat is Kosher or Halal (e.g., compliant with Jewish or Islamic dietary laws).",,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2020,7,,7,Frontiers in Nutrition,,2020,,2296-861X,,10.3389/fnut.2020.00007,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-07-23,2021-11-10

One focus of the study was the comparison of attitudes toward foods made from insects and cultured meat in general and in a specific form (a burger). Another focus was analyzing the influence of selected nutritional-psychological factors on the willingness of children and adolescents to consume these products. In addition to sociodemographic factors (age, sex), meat consumption, familiarity, attitudes, food neophobia, and food disgust were included as variables. The study participants showed a significantly higher willingness to consume the cultured meat burger than the insect burger, although no difference could be shown in their attitudes toward the alternatives as food (i.e., irrespective of their form of preparation). Hierarchical multiple regression revealed that the attitude toward the alternative protein product in burger form, specifically, was the strongest predictor for the willingness to consume both burger alternatives. This illustrates that the attitudes of children and adolescents toward a particular product are especially important. Therefore, a focus of food marketing and education should be on encouraging positive attitudes toward insect and cultured meat burgers in order to increase the willingness of children and adolescents to consume these alternative protein sources. The negative influence of food neophobia on the willingness to consume the meat alternatives, which had previously been reported in other studies, was confirmed in this study. In the model with the sociodemographic variables, food disgust showed a negative influence on the willingness to consume the two meat alternatives; however, this negative influence was not detected after including the nutritional-psychological variables in the model.

While most academic work on cell-cultured meat has focused on innovations for scalable muscle tissue culture, fat production is an important and often neglected component of this technology. Developing suitable biomanufacturing strategies for adipose tissue from agriculturally relevant animal species may be particularly beneficial due to the potential use of cell-cultured fat as a novel food ingredient. Scope and approach Here we review the relevant studies from areas of meat science, cell biology, tissue engineering, and bioprocess engineering to provide a foundation for the development of in vitro fat production systems. We provide an overview of adipose tissue biology and functionality with respect to meat products, then explore cell lines, bioreactors, and tissue engineering strategies of potential utility for in vitro adipose tissue production for food. Regulation and consumer acceptance are also discussed. Key findings and conclusions Existing strategies and paradigms are insufficient to meet the full set of unique needs for a cell-cultured fat manufacturing platform, as tradeoffs are often present between simplicity, scalability, stability, and projected cost. Identification and validation of appropriate cell lines, bioprocess strategies, and tissue engineering techniques must therefore be an iterative process as a deeper understanding of the needs and opportunities for cell-cultured fat develops.",Cell-cultured meat; Adipose tissue; Lipids; Meat science; Food manufacturing; Cellular agriculture,"Cultivated Meat Library,Cultivated Meat 101",Not CC-licensed,,,,,2020,,,,Trends Food Sci.

However, naming these products has been the subject of considerable debate. This study used a 3 × 10 between-subjects online experiment involving a quota sample of 3,186 U.S. adult panel participants to test common or usual names using images of realistic packages of three types of seafood that a consumer might encounter in a supermarket. The terms tested were, ""cell-based seafood,"" ""cell-cultured seafood,"" ""cultivated seafood,"" and ""cultured seafood"" and the phrases, ""produced using cellular aquaculture,"" ""cultivated from the cells of ____,"" and ""grown directly from the cells of ____,"" where the blanks are filled by the name of the seafood product. Five criteria were used for evaluation, including each term's ability to: enable consumers to distinguish cell-based seafood from wild and farmed fish, to signal potential allergenicity, be seen by consumers as an appropriate term to identify the product, not disparage either cell-based or conventional products, and not evoke thoughts, images, or emotions that are inconsistent with the idea that the products are safe, healthy, and nutritious. The results showed that ""cell-based seafood"" outperforms the other names tested. It enables consumers to recognize that the products are neither wild caught nor farm raised, signals potential allergenicity, is seen as an appropriate name for describing the technology/process, and it performs well with respect to measures of consumer acceptance, particularly in comparison to conventional products. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Creating consensus around a single common or usual name for cell-based meat, poultry, and seafood products is clearly important both for regulatory reasons and for shaping public perceptions and understanding of the products that are labeled with it. Our findings suggest that ""cell-based"" is the best common or usual name for seafood products that both meets FDA regulatory requirements and performs well with respect to potential consumer acceptance. Consistent use of this term by industry, advocates, and regulators would help orient consumers to what is likely to be a transformational food technology.",Cell-Based; Cell-Cultured; Common or Usual Name; Nomenclature; Seafood,"Cultivated Meat Library,PISCES/ATLAS",,,,,,2020,85,8,2267-2277,J.

Therefore, our aim is to analyse the knowledge and perspective of Brazilian veterinarians and animal scientists regarding cell-based meat. Veterinarians (76.8%; 209/272) and animal scientists (23.2%; 63/272) responded to an online survey. Logistic regression, latent class and logit models were used to evaluate objective answers, and the Discourse of the Collective Subject method was used to interpret open-ended answers. Specialists who were women (62.5%; 170/272), veterinarians (76.8%; 209/272), vegetarians (7.0%; 19/272) and vegans (1.1%; 3/272) were more supportive of cell-based meat. Lack of knowledge and the connection with artificiality, the most frequent spontaneous word associated with cell-based meat by all respondents, were the main negative points highlighted. Thus, it seems fundamental to offer higher education to veterinarians and animal scientists regarding cell-based meat, since engaging them with this novel technology may mitigate both the resistance and its negative consequences for the professionals, society, the animals involved and the environment.",,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2020,10,9,1678,Animals,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,2020-09-17,,,,10.3390/ani10091678,,,,"Animal Welfare Laboratory, Federal University of Paraná, Rua dos Funcionários, 1540, Curitiba, 80035-050, Brazil; Department of Statistics, Federal University of Paraná, Rua Cel.

Developers of these technologies claim their products, also known as “cell-based” or “cultivated” meat, will be safer and more environmentally friendly than conventional meat while offering improved farm-animal welfare. To these ends, Open Philanthropy commissioned this assessment of cultured meat’s potential to measurably displace the consumption of conventional meat. Recognizing that the scalability of any cultured-meat products must in turn depend on the scale and process intensity of animal cell production, this study draws on techno-economic analysis and due-diligence perspectives in industrial fermentation and upstream biopharmaceuticals to assess the extent to which animal cell culture could be scaled like a fermentation process. The analysis identifies a number of significant barriers to the scale-up of animal cell culture. Bioreactor design principles indicate a variety of issues associated with bulk cell growth in culture: Low growth rate, metabolic inefficiency, catabolite and CO2 inhibition, and bubble-induced cell damage will all limit practical bioreactor volume and attainable cell density. With existing bioreactor designs and animal cell lines, a significant engineering effort would be required to address even one of these issues. Economic challenges are further examined. Equipment and facilities with adequate microbial contamination safeguards are expected to have high capital costs. Suitable formulations of amino acids and protein growth factors are not currently produced at scales consistent with food production, and their projected costs at scale are likewise high. The replacement of amino-acid media with plant protein hydrolysates is discussed and requires further study. Capital- and operating-cost analyses of conceptual cell-mass production facilities indicate production economics that would likely preclude the affordability of their products as food. The analysis concludes that metabolic efficiency enhancements and the development of low-cost media from plant hydrolysates are both necessary but insufficient conditions for the measurable displacement of conventional meat by cultured meat.",animal cell culture; bioreactor design; cultured meat; economics; fermentation; scale-up; techno-economic analysis,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2020,,,,,,2020-12,,,,10.31224/osf.io/795su,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-07-23,2021-11-02

Alongside technological developments, the social impact of this innovation is being explored. Consumer acceptance will depend on multiple factors. For Orthodox Jews, the critical question will be whether the new food can be defined as kosher. In the absence of an exact precedent in Talmudic case law, scholars have begun to examine which set of principles would govern the status of the new meat product. Traditionally, meat is permitted for kosher consumption only when it derives from a kosher species which has been kosher slaughtered in accordance with strict regulations. There is room to suggest that this same set of rules would determine the status of any product derived through cellular agriculture, and thus the source cells would have to be extracted from a kosher species and only after kosher slaughter. Another approach would be to view the process as so different from the traditional growth of meat that it may be defined as kosher, even where traditional meat would not. Three determining factors will be: (1) the source of the original cells from which clean meat will be produced (animal species and cell type), (2) the nature of the growth medium, and (3) the exact nature of the process involved, which will determine whether the final product is considered a “new entity” or merely an “inheritance” of the starter cells.

While promising to be environmentally sustainable, cell-cultured meat has faced backlash from various industry stakeholders and lobbyists aiming to preserve more traditional forms of meat products. This article explores the current regulatory status of cell-cultured meat.

First, what is cell-cultured meat? It is a food product that is derived from animal cells but grown and harvested by scientists in laboratories. Cell-cultured meat can come from any animal traditionally raised for consumption including beef, poultry, swine, and fish. The process for growing cell-cultured meat is complex: cells are either collected through the biopsy of a living animal or taken from one recently slaughtered. The cells are grown in multiple stages to differentiate and mature. While differentiation allows the meat to have distinct texture and cellular form-picture the marbling of a steak-maturation is more complex and expensive. Maturation requires the cells to be placed into a type of scaffolding, and to grow in a nutrient-rich broth complex enough to sustain life. Alan Sachs & Sarah Kettenmann, A Burger by Any Other Name, 15 SciTech Lawyer 19 (Winter 2019).

Once cell-cultured meat can be produced at scale, environmental and social benefits are vast. Water consumption and land use from raising livestock could be reduced exponentially. Grain grown for animals, and the energy required to grow and harvest crops, could be used elsewhere. The uniform production could make meat products more affordable for low-income purchasers. Moreover, because the product is created in a sterilized laboratory environment, risks of animal-borne disease spreading to humans are lower.

As interest in cell-cultured meat grows, lawmakers around the globe are working to clarify which regulatory frameworks will apply to the growth and harvest of the product,...",,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2020,34,4,,American Bar Association,,2020,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-07-23,2021-11-10

This research assesses for which beliefs concerning intrinsic attributes and positive externalities, the provision of information is a sufficient tool for affecting the perception and acceptance of cultured meat on a panel of Italian consumers. Changes in perception and willingness to try, buy, and pay are assessed by measuring the variation before and after the provision of positive information related to the product. The results show that perception is affected by positive information concerning safety and nutritional characteristics, whereas the opposite occurs regarding the product flavor. Furthermore, findings reveal that, while the willingness to buy increases after providing positive information, the willingness to try does not.

Whilst establishing the basic science of cultured meat has been the primary focus of the last decade, it is now feasible that cultured meat products will enter the market within the next three to four years. This proximity to market introduction demands an evaluation of aspects of the cultured meat production process that have not yet been outlined or discussed in significant detail. For example, one technological approach for production of cultured meat utilizes adult muscle stem cells, the limited proliferative capacity of which necessitates repeated collection of tissue samples via biopsies of living donor animals. A key bottleneck in the cultured meat production process; the selection of donor animals and the details of biopsy processes themselves must be optimized. The number of stem cells harvested from a biopsy, together with their proliferative capacity, determine a 'multiplicity factor' achieved by a cultured meat production process, thus dictating the reduction in number of animals required to produce a given quantity of meat. This Perspective considers potential scenarios for these critical upstream steps, focusing on the production of cultured beef as an example. Considerations related to donor selection and details of the biopsy process are discussed in detail. Practicalities of various scenarios for cultured beef production, health of donor animals, and regulatory issues associated with the safety of cultured meat for consumers are also considered.

Using cultured myoblast cells, we examined ammonia’s effect on myostatin expression, a negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth, and myotube diameters. The objective of this study was to examine how murine, avian, and fish cells respond to increasing levels of ammonia up to 50 mM. The murine myoblast cell line (C2C12), primary chick, and primary tilapia myoblast cells were cultured and then exposed to 10, 25, and 50 mM ammonium acetate, sodium acetate, and an untreated control for 24 h. High levels of ammonia were detrimental to the C2C12 cells, causing increased Myostatin (MSTN) expression and decreased myotube diameters between 10 and 25 mM (p < 0.002). Ammonia at 10 mM continued the positive myogenic response in the chick, with lower MSTN expression than the C2C12 cells and larger myotube diameters, but the myotube diameter at 50 mM ammonium acetate was significantly smaller than those at 10 and 25 mM (p < 0.001). However, chick myotubes at 50 mM were still significantly larger than the sodium acetate-treated and untreated control (p < 0.001). The tilapia cells showed no significant difference in MSTN expression or myotube diameter in response to increasing the concentrations of ammonia. Overall, these results confirm that increasing concentrations of ammonia are detrimental to mammalian skeletal muscle, while chick cells responded positively at lower levels but began to exhibit a negative response at higher levels, as the tilapia experienced no detrimental effects. The differences in ammonia metabolism strategies between fish, avian, and mammalian species could potentially contribute to the differences between species in response to high levels of ammonia.

There are technical obstacles still hindering large-scale commercialization of cultivated meat, of which many are related to the media that are used to culture the muscle, fat, and connective tissue cells. While animal cell culture media has been used and refined for roughly a century, it has not been specifically designed with the requirements of cultivated meat in mind. Perhaps the most common industrial use of animal cell culture is currently the production of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, which sell for orders of magnitude more than meat. Successful production of cultivated meat requires media that is food grade with minimal cost, can regulate large-scale cell proliferation and differentiation, has acceptable sensory qualities, and is animal ingredient-free. Much insight into strategies for achieving media formulations with these qualities can be obtained from knowledge of conventional culture media applications and from the metabolic pathways involved in myogenesis and protein synthesis.

Methods to produce in vitro meat employ muscle cells cultivated on a scaffold in a serum-free medium using a bioreactor. The microstructure of the scaffold is a key factor, because muscle cells must be oriented to generate parallel alignments of fibers. This work aimed to develop a new scaffold (microstructured film) to grow muscle fibers. The microstructured edible films were made using micromolding technology. A micromold was tailor-made using a laser cutting machine to obtain parallel fibers with a diameter in the range of 70–90 µm. Edible films were made by means of solvent casting using non-mammalian biopolymers. Myoblasts were cultured on flat and microstructured films at three cell densities. Cells on the microstructured films grew with a muscle fiber morphology, but in the case of using the flat film, they only produced unorganized cell proliferation.

To understand drivers of consumer acceptance as well as sensory perception of cultured meat, we investigated the effect of information content on participants' acceptance of cultured meat in a tasting context. Hundred ninety-three citizens from the Netherlands participated, divided across three age and sex-matched groups which each received information on either societal benefits, personal benefits or information on the quality and taste of cultured meat. They filled out a questionnaire and tasted two pieces of hamburger, labeled 'conventional' or 'cultured', although both pieces were in fact conventional. Sensory analysis of both hamburgers was performed. We observed that provision of information and the tasting experience increased acceptance of cultured meat and that information on personal benefits of cultured meat increased acceptance more than information on quality and taste but not than societal benefits of cultured meat. Previous awareness of cultured meat was the best predictor of its acceptance. In contrast to previous studies, sex and social economic status were not associated with different acceptance rates. Surprisingly, 58% of the respondents were willing to pay a premium for cultured meat of, on average, 37% above the price of regular meat. All participants tasted the 'cultured' hamburger and evaluated its taste to be better than the conventional one in spite of the absence of an objective difference. This is the first acceptance study of cultured meat where participants were offered to eat and evaluate meat that was labeled 'cultured'.

Although promoted for their capacity to avoid or reduce the environmental, animal welfare, and, in some cases, public health problems associated with farmed meat production and consumption, little research has critically evaluated the broader potential public health and food systems implications associated with meat alternatives. This review explores key public health, environmental, animal welfare, economic, and policy implications related to the production and consumption of plant-based meat substitutes and cell-based meats, and how they compare to those associated with farmed meat production. Based on the limited evidence to date, it is unknown whether replacing farmed meats with plant-based substitutes would offer comparable nutritional or chronic disease reduction benefits as replacing meats with whole legumes. Production of plant-based substitutes, however, may involve smaller environmental impacts compared to the production of farmed meats, though the relative impacts differ significantly depending on the type of products under comparison. Research to date suggests that many of the purported environmental and health benefits of cell-based meat are largely speculative. Demand for both plant-based substitutes and cell-based meats may significantly reduce dependence on livestock to be raised and slaughtered for meat production, although cell-based meats will require further technological developments to completely remove animal-based inputs. The broader socioeconomic and political implications of replacing farmed meat with meat alternatives merit further research. An additional factor to consider is that much of the existing research on plant-based substitutes and cell-based meats has been funded or commissioned by companies developing these products, or by other organizations promoting these products. This review has revealed a number of research gaps that merit further exploration, ideally with independently funded peer-reviewed studies, to further inform the conversation around the development and commercialization of plant-based substitutes and cell-based meats.",,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2020,4,,134,Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems,,2020,,2571-581X,,10.3389/fsufs.2020.00134,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-07-23,2021-11-10

Namely, cross-taxa metabolic engineering of mammalian cells could offer value in applications ranging food and nutrition to regenerative medicine or gene therapy. Towards the former, recent advances in meat production through cell culture suggest the potential to produce meat with fine cellular control, where tuning composition through cross-taxa metabolic engineering could enhance nutrition and food-functionality. Here we demonstrate this possibility by engineering primary bovine and immortalized murine muscle cells with prokaryotic enzymes to endogenously produce the antioxidant carotenoids phytoene, lycopene and β-carotene. These phytonutrients offer general nutritive value and protective effects against diseases associated with red and processed meat consumption, and so offer a promising proof-of-concept for nutritional engineering in cultured meat. We demonstrate the phenotypic integrity of engineered cells, the ability to tune carotenoid yields, and antioxidant functionality of these compounds in vitro towards both nutrition and food-quality objectives.

Commercially available for decades but at a critical inflection point due to recent technical innovation, plant-based meat products hold a tremendous potential to reduce demand for conventional meat provided that they meet consumers’ desired product expectations and are marketed effectively. Currently a small body of market and scholarly research has examined consumer perceptions of such products. While market shares of plant-based meat, eggs, and dairy are increasing, some consumers still have aversions and barriers to consuming plant-based meat.

Regarding cultivated meat, we are at a critical juncture where the product will soon be on the market, and yet consumer awareness is relatively low. We therefore have the impactful opportunity to form consumer opinions. It is far easier to form opinions than it is to change them, and it is far more effective to lead a narrative than it is to react to others’ narratives.

To take early research on consumer attitudes towards the novel meat, this paper investigated consumer awareness of, acceptance of and willingness to pay for artificial meat firstly, and then explored those for cultured meat after information provision, by a questionnaire survey (n = 1,004) in three cities, Beijing, Qingdao and Tai'an. The results showed that the overwhelming majority were unacquainted with artificial meat including cultured meat. Nearly 22% were opposed to artificial meat, and approximately 50% remained neutral. However, after reading the information about cultured meat, only 12% of respondents were opposed, and the percentage that remained neutral decreased to 40%, which signified that respondents may have had a misconception about the novel meat and information provision was an effective way to encourage the public to express their opinions and be more accepting.

Younger males with a higher education, those who thought highly of the meat and more satisfied with the government's regulation of food safety were more likely to accept and try cultured meat.

Despite ample attention to issues of naming and regulation, the effect of information provision on consumer attitudes and evaluations has received less interest, even as claims (positive and negative) about cultivated meat increase in scope and complexity. Accordingly, we employed a 2x2 experimental design with information treatments varying by valence and complexity to explore if information provision influenced purchasing evaluations by way of attitudes. Using a sample of 617 German consumers, we found that whether information accentuated the risks or benefits of cultivated meat had a fundamental impact on explicit attitudes and purchasing evaluations, but not implicit attitudes. The role of complexity was however more nuanced, with an impact only on explicit attitudes and when risks were accentuated. Moreover, using mediation analysis, we revealed that implicit and explicit attitudes serially mediated the relationship between information provision and purchasing evaluations, thereby affecting the overall effectiveness of information. In sum, the findings underscore the importance of implicit and explicit attitudes (as well as food technology neophobia and prior knowledge) for evaluation processes of consumers, along with how disentangling the respective effects of valence and complexity of information enables the development of more effective and tailored messaging approaches.",cultivated meat; consumer evaluation; implicit attitude; information provision; food technology neophobia; mediation analysis; D12; D91; Q16; Q18; D83,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2021,,,104226,Food Qual.

The spatially controlled microarchitecture achieved here, resembles a muscle fascicle at each intercalated layer. This straightforward approach promotes an effective alignment of cells (~60%) with respect to the filament axis. The expression of myosin and sarcomeric actin was verified at day 28.

The objective of this study is to identify which attributes influence consumers to possibly replace conventional beef meat with cultured meat in Brazil. An online survey was conducted, and Best-worst scaling methodology was applied to a sample of 225 consumers. The sampling leaned towards educated and employed residents of the southeast region of Brazil, which might not fully represent the Brazilian population. Despite limitations in terms of the sampling demographic, overall, Brazilians appear to be willing to consume cultured meat: 80.9% of the sample would be willing to try it, 61.3% would be willing to eat it regularly, and 56.9% would be willing to eat cultured meat as a replacement for conventionally produced beef. Despite the focus of this study being on attributes of a hypothetical product that is not commercially available, which might pose difficulty to consumers to predict their future consumption behavior, results show that the most important attributes influencing consumers to possibly replace conventional beef meat by cultured meat in Brazil are anticipated risk of zoonotic diseases, anticipated healthiness and anticipated food safety conditions.

However, the question arises, once cultured meat commercialises and enters the market, will Muslims cease from slaughtering livestock? Scope and approach This commentary aims to answer the question by analysing two primary sources of Islam, namely the al-Quran and hadith, with further contextual substantiation from authoritative opinions of scholars. Key finding and Conclusion: Cultured meat has the potential to become an alternative to conventional meat in the market with conditions stipulated by Shariah guidelines.

In this study, we attempted to fabricate a three-dimensional (3-D) tissue by co-cultivation of animal cells with photosynthetic autotrophic microalgae so as to produce thicker and healthy cultured foods. RESULTS: Metabolism and damage of co-cultured tissues fabricated by microalgae, Chlorella vulgaris (C. vulgaris), and C2C12 cells were compared to monoculture tissues fabricated by C2C12 animal cells alone. Although the metabolism of monoculture tissue showed anaerobic respiration (ratio of lactate production to glucose consumption, LG ratio: 2.01 ± 0.15), that of the co-culture tissue partially changed to efficient aerobic respiration (LG ratio: 1.58 ± 0.14). In addition, the amount of ammonia in the culture media decreased markedly by co-cultivation. The release of lactate dehydrogenase from the thicker tissue was one-seventh in the co-cultivation, showing improved tissue damage. The co-cultivation with microalgae improved the culture condition of thicker tissues, resulting in the fabrication/maintenance of 200-400 µm-thickness tissues. The co-cultured tissue fabricated by microalgae and animal cells was not only rich in nutrients but also enabled thicker tissue fabrication without tissue damage as compared to tissue fabricated by animal cells alone.

In the field of in-vitro meat production, it is important to tune appropriately the cell growth phase to obtain sufficient high biomass prior to entering to cell differentiation (nonproliferative stage). Moreover, the understanding of the kinetics associated with myoblast cell growth is necessary for scaling-up the production through the use of bioreactors. In this work, the growth of myoblasts paralleled aligned into an edible micropatterned film mimicking muscle fiber was modelled using the cubic Moser equation, where the oxygen diffusion into microchannels was calculated using a mass transfer approach. The availability of oxygen in contact with the muscle cells was lower in microchannels compared to a flat surface. These results demonstrate that microchannels offer to limit oxygen substrate to cultivate in-vitro meat. The results were consistent with observations of the cell growth onto two kinds of micropatterned edible films, which were fabricated using non-mammalian gelatin, alginate, agarose and glycerol or sorbitol as plasticizers, all of them already used as edible additives in the food industry.",Cell growth; Edible films; In-vitro meat; Mathematical modelling; Oxygen diffusion,"Cultivated Meat Library,Deep dive: Cultivated meat scaffolding part B",,,,,,2021,307,,110662,J.

Cellular agriculture has the potential to produce meat that replicates the structure of traditionally produced meat while minimizing the land needed. There is a need for an edible scaffold suitable for the growth of animal muscle. This study showed that decellularizing spinach leaves produced an edible scaffold that has a vascular network that could potentially maintain the viability of primary bovine satellite cells as they develop into meat. Primary bovine satellite cells were cultured on the surface of decellularized spinach leaves and gelatin coated glass for 7 and 14 days. After 14 days, primary bovine satellite cells seeded on the decellularized leaf scaffold maintained ∼99% viability; and ∼25% of the cells showed expression of the myosin heavy-chain. Cell alignment varied between animals from which the cells were acquired. Areas of alignment were observed showing an average kappa value for cytoskeletal alignment of 0.71±0.1 after 14 days in culture. There was no statistical significance in each category between cells cultured on gelatin coated glass and decellularized spinach leaves.

Because actual meat is an aligned assembly of the fibers connected to the tendon for the actions of contraction and relaxation, tendon-gel integrated bioprinting was developed to construct tendon-like gels. In this study, a total of 72 fibers comprising 42 muscles, 28 adipose tissues, and 2 blood capillaries were constructed by tendon-gel integrated bioprinting and manually assembled to fabricate steak-like meat with a diameter of 5 mm and a length of 10 mm inspired by a meat cut.

Alternative meat (alt-meat) products (e.g., plant-based and cultured meat) are substitutes for animal meat products, made using innovative food technologies. The potential environmental impacts of plant-based and cultured meat have been well-explored but the social and economic impacts of alt-meat have received less attention, particularly as they relate to rural communities. This paper addresses the research question: What are social and economic opportunities and challenges of cultured and plant-based meat for rural producers in the US? We conducted semi-structured interviews with 37 expert informants, including representatives of cultured meat companies, plant-based meat companies, non-profit organizations, funding agencies, governmental agencies, and the beef, soy, and pea sectors, as well as researchers and farmers. Our interviews revealed a range of ways in which alt-meat sectors might present opportunities or threats for rural producers in the US. Opportunities included growing crops as ingredients for plant-based meat or feedstock for cultured meat; raising animals for genetic material for cultured meat; producing cultured meat in bioreactors at the farm level; transitioning into new sectors; new market opportunities for blended and hybrid animal- and alt-meat products; and new value around regenerative or high-animal welfare farming. Threats included loss of livelihood or income for ranchers and livestock producers and for farmers growing crops for animal feed; barriers to transitioning into emerging alt-meat sectors; and the possibility of exclusion from those sectors. Interviewees also identified a range of roles for universities and research organizations, government agencies, and non-profit organizations that could help to maximize the benefits and minimize the risks from emerging alt-meat sectors. Finally, most interviewees thought it likely that alt-meat would form an additional form of protein that captured some or all of the anticipated growing demand for protein rather than one that displaced animal meat entirely. As such, the emergence of alt-meat sectors alongside animal agriculture may offer more choices for rural producers in terms of which markets they sell to and what forms of production they adopt or pursue.

In contrast to animal-based production of traditional meat, the cultured meat approach entails laboratory cultivation of engineered muscle tissue. However, bioengineers have hitherto engineered tissues to fulfil biomedical endpoints, and have had limited experience in engineering muscle tissue for its post-mortem traits, which broadly govern consumer definitions of meat quality. Furthermore, existing tissue engineering approaches face fundamental challenges in technical feasibility and industrial scalability for cultured meat production. This review discusses how animal-based meat production variables influence meat properties at both the molecular and functional level, and whether current cultured meat approaches recapitulate these properties. In addition, this review considers how conventional meat producers employ exogenous biopolymer-based meat ingredients and processing techniques to mimic desirable meat properties in meat products. Finally, current biomaterial strategies for engineering muscle and adipose tissue are surveyed in the context of emerging constraints that pertain to cultured meat production, such as edibility, sustainability and scalability, and potential areas for integrating biomaterials and food biopolymer approaches to address these constraints are discussed. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Laboratory-grown or cultured meat has gained increasing interest from industry and the public, but currently faces significant impediment to market feasibility. This is due to fundamental knowledge gaps in producing realistic meat tissues via conventional tissue engineering approaches, as well as translational challenges in scaling up these approaches in an efficient, sustainable and high-volume manner. By defining the molecular basis for desirable meat quality attributes, such as taste and texture, and introducing the fundamental roles of food biopolymers in mimicking these properties in conventional meat products, this review aims to bridge the historically disparate fields of meat science and biomaterials engineering in order to inspire potentially synergistic strategies that address some of these challenges.",Adipose; Cultured meat; Food biopolymers; Muscle; Tissue engineering,"Cultivated Meat Library,Deep dive: Cultivated meat scaffolding part B",,,,,,2021,124,,108-129,Acta Biomater.,,2021-01-17,,1742-7061,1878-7568,10.1016/j.actbio.2021.01.017,33472103,,,"Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology (A*STAR), 31 Biopolis Way, The Nanos, 138669, Singapore.

The alarming growth in population vis-à-vis current food production is expected to increase the global food insecurity levels. Inter alia, cellular agriculture – an incipient technology – is being considered as a potential alternative to cater for the growing demand for food and nutrition. The technology aims to develop edible agricultural products including meat with reduced environmental footprint against conventional farm production. In this context, an attempt has been made to review the progress of cellular agriculture research in four decades (1981-2020) through a bibliometric analysis and to suggest a roadmap for future research. The study sourced data from the Web of Science during October 2020. Using keywords, the database showed 212 searches pertaining to cellular agriculture from 135 journals worldwide. Of the journals, seven had at least five published articles and 33 had two articles each. Subsequently, the bibliographic coupling among the identified journals was carried out. It is found that the Journals: Appetite, Meat Science, and Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics had the largest circles corresponding to their respective number of publications coupled with notable linkages with other journals. Also, a detailed analysis was performed on categories, growth trend, keywords, institutions, regions and leading researchers of cellular agriculture. The findings indicate that the Appetite Journal followed by the Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics had published a significant percentage of articles on cellular agriculture, and Environmental Science and Technology was identified as the highly cited journal. The USA, England and the Netherlands were identified as the progressive regions in cellular agriculture research. The bibliometric analysis points to sluggish progress in cellular agriculture research and production despite its potential benefits.

The emerging technology of 3D printing (3DP) has been recognized for its unprecedented capacity to fabricate food products with intricate structures and reduced material cost and energy. For sustainable 3DP of meat substitutes, the possible materials discussed are derived from in vitro cell culture, meat byproducts/waste, insects, and plants. These material-based approaches are analyzed from their potential environmental effects, technological viability, and consumer acceptance standpoints. Although skeletal muscles and skin are bioprinted for medical applications, they could be utilized as meat without the additional printing of vascular networks. The impediments to bioprinting of meat are lack of food-safe substrates/materials, cost-effectiveness, and scalability. The sustainability of bioprinting could be enhanced by the utilization of generic/universal components or scaffolds and optimization of cell sourcing and fabrication logistics. Despite the availability of several plants and their byproducts and some start-up ventures attempting to fabricate food products, 3D printing of meat analogues remains a challenge. From various insects, powders, proteins (soluble/insoluble), lipids, and fibers are produced, which—in different combinations and at optimal concentrations—can potentially result in superior meat substitutes. Valuable materials derived from meat byproducts/wastes using low energy methods could reduce waste production and offset some greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Apart from printer innovations (speed, precision, and productivity), rational structure of supply chain and optimization of material flow and logistic costs can improve the sustainability of 3D printing. Irrespective of the materials used, perception-related challenges exist for 3D-printed food products. Consumer acceptance could be a significant challenge that could hinder the success of 3D-printed meat analogs.",3D printing; meat analogs; sustainability; environmental impact,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2021,13,2,938,Sustainability,,2021,,1541-3004,,10.3390/su13020938,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-07-23,2021-11-14

In search for solutions, regulations and product traceability have been used. Despite the urgency of the subject, less attention has been given to how radical innovations may lead to preventing animal welfare and environmental misconduct. Technological radical innovations are characterized by their uniqueness, novelty, and potential to promote significant transformations in a chain. Thus, we adopted an exploratory approach to analyze the case of a radical technological innovation – cell-based meat – which can substantially transform the meat value chain and, more specifically, mitigate overwhelming environmental and animal welfare misconduct in the tuna global chain. The case illustrates how radical innovation can significantly change global value chain's activities and redefine its geographic scope; it may also represent a shift from natural resource-intensive to technology-intensive activities. More importantly, by substituting animal-based inputs, severe environmental and animal welfare issues will be mitigated.",Radical innovation; Global value chain; Environmental misconduct; Animal welfare; Cultivated meat,"Cultivated Meat Library,PISCES/ATLAS",,,,,,2021,169,,120845,Technol.

One approach to meet this insatiable demand is to use biofabrication methods used in tissue engineering in order to make skeletal muscle tissue-like constructs known as cultivated meat to be used as a food source. Here, we demonstrate the use of a scaffold-free biofabrication method that forms cell sheets composed of murine adipocytes and skeletal muscle cells and assembles these sheets in parallel to create a 3D meat-like construct without the use of any exogenous materials. This layer-by-layer self-assembly and stacking process is fast (4 days of culture to form sheets and few hours for assembly) and scalable (stable sheets with diameters >3 cm are formed). Tissues formed with only muscle cells were equivalent to lean meat with comparable protein and fat contents (lean beef had 1.5 and 0.9 times protein and fat, respectively, as our constructs) and incorporating adipocyte cells in different ratios to myoblasts and/or treatment with different media cocktails resulted in a 5% (low fat meat) to 35% (high fat meat) increase in the fat content.

However, research and development has been hindered by the lack of suitable serum-free media that enable the robust expansion of relevant cells (e.g., muscle satellite cells) over multiple passages. Recently, a low-cost serum-free media (B8) was described for induced pluripotent stem cells. Here, we adapt this media for bovine satellite cells and show that the addition of a single component, recombinant albumin, renders B8 suitable for the long-term expansion of cells without sacrificing myogenicity. We show that this new media (Beefy-9) maintains robust cell growth over the entire culture period tested (seven passages) with an average growth rate of 39 hours per population doubling). Along with demonstrated efficacy for bovine cells, this work provides a promising starting-point for developing serum-free media for cultures from other meat-relevant species. Ultimately, this work offers a promising foundation for escaping the reliance on serum in cultured meat research, thereby accelerating the field. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.",,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,Bos taurus,,2021,,,2021.05.28.446057,,,2021-05-29,,,,10.1101/2021.05.28.446057,,,,,en,,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,2021-07-23,2023-02-10

To this end, we recruited large representative samples to participate in an online survey about cultivated meat, and subsequently analyzed segments (a) in the early majority population (guided by the Diffusion of Innovations Model), (b) by generation, and (c) in the general population. Our findings showed a high level of openness (80%) in both the US and UK populations, with 40% somewhat or moderately likely to try and 40% highly likely to try. Younger generations had the greatest openness: 88% of Gen Z, 85% of Millennials, 77% of Gen X, and 72% of Baby Boomers were at least somewhat open to trying cultivated meat. All segments envisioned cultivated meat to be nearly half of their total meat intake. Findings show that consumers prefer the terms ‘cultured’ and ‘cultivated’ over ‘cell-based’ and ‘cell-cultured’ for use in a social context and on packages, even though they perceive these terms as less descriptive. The most important on-package label was one indicating government assurances, and participants preferred non-GM products over GM products.

The review examines their microstructural, colorimetric, printability, rheological and textural properties and investigates how these properties correlate to or are reflected in the characteristics of the printed constructs. These characteristics include their shape and dimensional stability, textural, nutritional, microstructural and sensorial properties. The review also examines the potential for development of animal protein-based special diets for people with special requirements such as for dysphagia patients and geriatrics. A special focus has been given to the application of transglutaminase for the development of 3D fish-based products and the possibility of developing cultured meat-based products.

Scope and approach: The properties of different food inks and 3D printed constructs based on animal proteins such as beef, poultry, fish, egg, seafood, milk, cheese and dairy ingredients were analysed with emphasis on the studies that were published in the last three years. Studies on the development of special animal protein-based diets and the possibility of 3D printed products based on cultured meat were critically reviewed. Key findings and conclusions 3D food printing offers numerous possibilities for development of tailored animal protein-based structures and products which includes, but is not limited to, extraordinary flexibility in geometries, textures and flavours and customised nutrition. Technology for production of 3D printed meat products necessitates the reduction of particle size of meat and dilution of meaty and savoury flavour and this is generally expected to reduce the value of premium meat products. However, the technology might be a good option for utilization of lower value and tougher cuts and trimmings. Production of 3D printed cultured meat-based products is still at a conceptual stage and a little or no research has been done in this area. Consumer acceptance of 3D printed cultured meat products seems to be less favourable in Western countries like Australia. Technology for the production of several animal protein-based 3D printed products for special dietary requirements such as for dysphagia patients has been optimized and is currently feasible with good success. Fancy shaped 3D printed cheese and egg products may evolve as a new segment of foods with a focus on children, festive occasions and the personal gift market. This review expands our understanding of how the composition of food inks affects the properties of the printed constructs and generates knowledge that will be crucial for optimizing the 3D printed animal products for maximum nutritional and sensory benefits. Extensive research is required to develop unique animal-based products with functional and nutraceutical value to attract consumers. Scientific knowledge is required to decipher the underlying mechanisms of how 3D printing process affects the food microstructure and sensory characteristics and its impact on consumer acceptance that will expand the use of the technology within the food industry.",3D printing; Animal protein; Transglutaminase; Special foods; Cultured meat,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2021,118,,87-105,Trends Food Sci.

Rearing an animal requires land, water, and other resources, which is challenging to feed the growing population in the world. Therefore, lab-grown meat is one of the optional replacements for farmed animal meat production. Tissue engineering-based cellular agriculture is adopted for production, where bioreactors are used for the cellular harvest. Ample beneficial aspects bring cultured meat to the frontline in the food industry. Cell-based meats are environment friendly in the context of greenhouse gas production, less prone to contamination of infectious pathogens compared with livestock animals. The nutritional content of cultured meat can be regulated, which made it unique. There are disadvantageous aspects too. Cell-based meat is expected to consume higher energy and produce more carbon dioxide than potent methane, impacting the environment.

Effectively rendering farmed animals obsolete in food production could mitigate an array of harms inflicted by industrial animal farming on the environment, public health, and human and animal wellbeing, but achieving this outcome is contingent on cellular agriculture entrepreneurs successfully creating a product that closely resembles conventional meat enough to appeal to consumers despite its synthetic origins. This article examines how these politics of resemblance may shape and limit the realization of the industry’s potential benefits. Specifically, it argues that, while cellular agriculture can only realize such benefits through the facilitation of agricultural animal obsolescence, its potential for positive transformations in food production may ultimately be blunted by the degree to which a failure to extend the politics of resemblance from the consumer market to the labor market renders agricultural human laborers obsolete as well.","cellular agriculture, animals, meat, food politics, synthetic",Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2021,26,,37-50,TSANTSA – Journal of the Swiss Anthropological Association,University of Bern,2021-06-30,,2673-5377,1420-7834,10.36950/tsantsa.2021.26.6943,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-11-12,2021-11-22

Both commercial fishing and aquaculture harm the environment, threaten public health, and entail morally dubious practices. While consumers have increasingly become aware of the implications of the global fishing industry, most still want to eat seafood. Recent advancements in food technology have resulted in the successful production of cell-cultivated fish. Grown from real fish cells, cell-cultivated seafood avoids many of the issues associated with conventional fish production. Although cell-cultivated seafood will soon be available to consumers, there is not yet consensus on a ‘common or usual name’, a requirement of the US Food and Drug Administration for novel foods. We present a public discourse analysis, and the results of two online US-based surveys (n=2,452 and n=1,839) analyzing consumer acceptance and understanding of key terms used to describe cultured fish. Adult participants were tested for knowledge and acceptability of multiple descriptive terms: Bio-crafted, Bio-Cultivated, Cell-based, Cultivated, Cultured, Molecular, and the coined term ‘Novari’. The Control was a description of the product coupled with realistic packaging a consumer may expect to find once the product is available for purchase. The discourse analysis indicated that there is no current consensus on terminology used to describe cell-cultivated meat, and that some of the most commonly-used terms currently tend to be used in a negative context. Our Phase I survey revealed that names such as ‘cell-based’ and ‘bio-crafted’ were more likely to be understood, but relatively unappealing, while names such as ‘cultivated’ and ‘Novari’ were more appealing, but less likely to be understood. Our Phase II survey further revealed that the term ‘cell-cultivated’ combined promising elements of these terms, and was subsequently more appealing than ‘cell-based’ and better-understood than both ‘cultivated’ and ‘cell-based’. That said, none of the names tested outperformed the control group in consumer ability to identify the product accurately",,"Cultivated Meat Library,PISCES/ATLAS",,,,,,2021,,,,Research Square,,2021-07-01,,,,10.21203/rs.3.rs-646082/v1,,,,University of Edinburgh; University of Bath,en,,Research Square,,,,,,,,,2021-11-12,2021-11-16

Proliferation of bovine satellite cells isolated on the day of arrival or after 2 and 5 days of tissue storage were analyzed by metabolic and DNA-based assays, while their myogenic characteristics were investigated using RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence. Extended tissue storage up to 5 days did not negatively affect proliferation nor the ability to undergo fusion and create myosin heavy chain-positive myotubes. The expression patterns of myogenic and muscle-specific genes were also not affected after tissue storage. In fact, the data indicated a positive trend in terms of myogenic potential after tissue storage, although it was non-significant.

Cultured meat has to recreate the complex structure of livestock muscles with a few cells. Cells start to divide after they are cultured in a culture medium, which provides nutrients, hormones, and growth factors. An initial problem with this type of culture is the serum used, as in vitro meat aims to be slaughter free. Thus, it is contradictory to use a medium made from the blood of dead calves. The serum is expensive and affects to a large extent the production cost of the meat. A positive aspect related to the safety of cultured meat is that it is not produced from animals raised in confined spaces and slaughtered in inhumane conditions.

Low growth rate, metabolic inefficiency, catabolite inhibition, and shear-induced cell damage will all limit practical bioreactor volume and attainable cell density.

Displayed on packages of frozen Atlantic Salmon, both ""Cell-Based"" (60.1%) and ""Cell-Cultured"" (58.9%) enabled participants to differentiate the novel products from ""Farm-Raised"" and ""Wild-Caught"" fish and 74% also recognized that those allergic to fish should not consume the product. Thus, both names met key regulatory criteria. Both names were seen as appropriate terms for describing the process for creating the product, meeting the criteria for transparency. There were no significant differences in the perceived safety, naturalness, taste, or nutritiousness of the products bearing the two names. However, participants' overall impressions associated with ""Cell-Based"" were rated as more positive than those associated with ""Cell-Cultured"" (P < 0.001, η2 = 0.010), as were their initial thoughts, images, and feelings (P < 0.001, η2 = 0.008). The participants were also slightly more interested in tasting (P < 0.05, η2 = 0.004) and in purchasing (P < 0.01, η2 = 0.006) ""Cell-Based"" than ""Cell-Cultured"" seafood.

Although artificial meat may supplement or even replace traditional meat, it is still a challenge to reproduce muscle tissue's hierarchical structure.

Scope and approach: This review focused on the research history of artificial meat, the current technological challenges and possible solutions, and analyzed consumer attitudes toward artificial meat. Key findings and conclusions: With the rapid development of tissue engineering and bioreactor engineering, the new technologies for cultured meat have been continuously developed and improved. Extrusion, shear cell, and spinning are the main techniques for plant-based meat and its market has been expanding. Consumer attitudes toward cultured and plant-based meat vary by demographics and across cultures. There are some problems still needed to be overcome, including technology barriers and sensory, nutritional, health, and safety challenges in further developing the alternative meat market.",Artificial meat; Cultured meat; Plant-based meat; Traditional meat; Consumer attitudes,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2021,116,,434-444,Trends Food Sci.

Here we demonstrate the capacity of a nonlinear design-of-experiments (DOE) method to predict optimal media conditions in fewer experiments than a traditional DOE. The approach is based on a hybridization of a coordinate search for local optimization with dynamically adjusted search spaces and a global search method utilizing a truncated genetic algorithm using radial basis functions to store and model prior knowledge. Using this method, we were able to reduce the cost of muscle cell proliferation media while maintaining cell growth 48 hours after seeding using 30 common components of typical commercial growth medium in fewer experiments than a traditional DOE (70 vs 103). While we clearly demonstrated that the experimental optimization algorithm significantly outperforms conventional DOE, due to the choice of a 48 hour growth assay weighted by medium cost as an objective function, these findings were limited to performance at a single passage, and did not generalize to growth over multiple passages.

Design/methodology/approach Latent class cluster analysis was conducted using online survey data obtained from a nationally representative sample of 1,078 Australian food shoppers.

Findings Six consumer clusters were identified, each distinct in their degree of willingness to consume LGM and in their food choice values. Three clusters (49% of consumers) indicated some willingness to consume LGM. One segment, “Prospective LGM eaters” (12%), appeared “very willing” to consume LGM. These consumers were more likely to be younger (<35 years); university-educated; have greater prior awareness of LGM; stronger beliefs regarding the potential self- and society-related benefits of growing demand for LGM; and higher trust in diverse information sources.Practical implications Insights on the characteristics of each cluster provide useful information for the industry on how to tailor product development and marketing strategies to address the needs of consumers with the greatest potential to consume LGM.

This State is characterized by its strong cultural identity and social practices, barbecue being its typical dish.

Design/methodology/approach The authors applied a cross-sectional survey with meat consumers residing in Porto Alegre/RS, the sample of which, composed of 538 individuals, expressed the population heterogeneity. The data were analyzed using the Pearson chi-square, Cramer's V, and correspondence analysis.

Findings The results demonstrate that although six of ten people were willing to try cultured meat, only four of them responded positively to the willingness to consume it over conventional meat. Young individuals demonstrated a favorable attitude towards the product, expressing a greater propensity both to try it and to include it in the diet regularly. However, the rejection of cultured meat gradually intensified after 40 years old. The previous knowledge and familiarity with the investigated subject are not predictive of the intention of experimentation so that almost two-thirds of the individuals who did not know the product were positively willing to try it.

The role of livestock in supporting human well-being is especially contentious in discourses around sustainable diets. There is considerable variation in which environmental metrics are measured when describing sustainable diets, although some estimate of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of different diets based on varying assumptions is commonplace. A market for animal-free and manufactured food items to substitute for animal source food (ASF) has emerged, driven by the high GHG emissions of ASF. Ingredients sourced from plants, and animal cells grown in culture are two approaches employed to produce alternative meats. These can be complemented with ingredients produced using synthetic biology. Alternative meat companies promise to reduce GHG, the land and water used for food production, and reduce or eliminate animal agriculture. Some CEOs have even claimed alternative meats will ‘end world hunger’. Rarely do such self-proclamations emanate from scientists, but rather from companies in their efforts to attract venture capital investment and market share. Such declarations are reminiscent of the early days of the biotechnology industry. At that time, special interest groups employed fear-based tactics to effectively turn public opinion against the use of genetic engineering to introduce sustainability traits, like disease resistance and nutrient fortification, into global genetic improvement programs. These same groups have recently turned their sights on the ‘unnaturalness’ and use of synthetic biology in the production of meat alternatives, leaving agriculturists in a quandary. Much of the rationale behind alternative meats invokes a simplistic narrative, with a primary focus on GHG emissions, ignoring the nutritional attributes and dietary importance of ASF, and livelihoods that are supported by grazing ruminant production systems. Diets with low GHG emissions are often described as sustainable, even though the nutritional, social and economic pillars of sustainability are not considered. Nutritionists, geneticists, and veterinarians have been extremely successful at developing new technologies to reduce the environmental footprint of ASF. Further technological developments are going to be requisite to continuously improve the efficiency of animal source, plant source, and cultured meat production. Perhaps there is an opportunity to collectively communicate how innovations are enabling both alternative- and conventional-meat producers to more sustainably meet future demand. This could counteract the possibility that special interest groups who promulgate misinformation, fear and uncertainty, will hinder the adoption of technological innovations to the ultimate detriment of global food security.",Cultured meat; Environment; Life cycle assessment; Plant-based meat; Sustainable diet,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2021,15,10,100360,Animal,,2021-10-01,,1751-7311,,10.1016/j.animal.2021.100360,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-11-12,2021-11-23

Improved animal welfare emerged as the strongest motive for considering whether to eat cultured meat, whereas cultured meat's perceived unnaturalness emerged as the strongest barrier.

Based on the logistic regression estimates, simulations of the probability to eat cultured meat are provided for different profiles of consumers and depending on their strength of motives and perceived barriers. The use of ‘cultured’, ‘in-vitro’ or ‘synthetic’ when framing cultured meat did not significantly affect willingness to eat in the full model. Meanwhile, the likelihood of being willing to eat cultured meat was eight times larger among males compared to females; decreased by 50% per increase of 10 years in age; and was 14 times higher among non-vegetarians compared to vegetarians.

The findings demonstrate what problems animal cell-cultured meat has been positioned as the solution to, and what problems emerge from this new technology that regulators are expected to respond to. The problem representation and the solutions posed reproduce understandings that normalize and promote high and increasing levels of animal flesh consumption and related intensive uses of animals.

These AP products, which include plant-based meat and dairy alternatives and cell-cultured meat and seafood products, are being developed for the marketplace to simulate the appearance, texture, taste, and flavor and nutritional profiles of animal products. The new generation of AP plant-based and cell-cultured food and beverage products are part of a market-driven narrative that has embraced technology to address future human health, environmental, ethical, and planetary health challenges. This perspective article synthesizes evidence about the benefits of adopting minimally processed plant-based diets that support sustainable food systems and human and planetary health. Thereafter, it examines 4 wicked challenges related to AP products in the US context that include 1) a confusing marketing landscape for the public; 2) diverse views and varying acceptance among consumers about the health and environmental benefits of these products; 3) inadequate education and labeling provided by federal agencies to enable consumers to understand how these may support healthy sustainable diets; and 4) slow federal policy and regulatory actions to address the range of AP products and provide industry guidance. The article concludes with suggested policies and actions for government agencies and food system actors to address these challenges. Future research and actions are needed to balance the human health, equity, animal welfare, and economic viability goals and to clarify how AP products may support safe, healthy, sustainable diets and food systems.",diet; beverages; food; meat; plants; marketing,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2021,,,nmab113,Adv.

In this study, we isolated high purity of smooth muscle cells from vascular tissues. The addition of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) to the medium significantly increased the growth rate of smooth muscle cells and the expression of extracellular matrix related genes, especially collagen and elastin. Smooth muscle cells were seeded in a collagen gel to construct a culture meat model. It was found that the pressure loss of the model meat significantly decreased from 98.5 % in control group to 54 % with the extension of culture time for 9 days, while the total collagen content of model meat increased significantly (P < 0.05). In addition, the hydrogel tissue with smooth muscle cells compacted more dramatically and were more tightly, accompanied by significantly increased hardness, springiness and chewiness compared to the control one (P < 0.05).

The answers of 4471 respondents concluded that 46.6% of them thought “cell-based meat” was promising and acceptable. More than 66% would be willing to try this novel product compared to 23% who expressed reluctance to do so. Nearly 40% of the total respondents did not want to eat “cell-based meat” regularly at all, whereas 29%, 43.2%, and 39.9% were willing to eat it regularly in restaurants, at home, and/or in ready-made meals, respectively. However, the majority of respondents (71%) were keen to pay much less for “cell-based meat” than conventionally produced meat (or even nothing at all), compared to 24.3% who were willing to pay the same price as conventional meat, whereas only 4.8% were willing to pay more. Approximately 51% of them considered that “cell-based meat” should not be called “meat” for marketing purposes. Job, monthly income, age, and gender were major factors impacting consumer acceptance. Meat professionals and consumers with higher incomes were less willing to eat “cell-based meat” regularly. Women (especially younger women) were the most concerned about the ethical and environmental issues related to meat production and were the most convinced that reducing meat consumption could be a good solution to the meat industry’s problems. Respondents who did not accept “cell-based meat” and did not eat meat substitutes had a negative attitude to this novel food (they considered it absurd and/or disgusting) and did not believe that “cell-based meat” should be called “meat” for marketing purposes. In contrast, the people who thought that “cell-based meat” could be called “meat” perceived it in a rather positive way. These results are important for consumers of meat and meat substitutes and for companies aiming to enter the potential future Brazilian market of “cell-based meat”.",meat alternatives; food security; survey; livestock issues; animal protection; animal welfare; animal production,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2021,10,11,2588,Foods,,2021-10-26,,,,10.3390/foods10112588,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-11-12,2021-11-22

The primary cell cultures were initiated by incomplete trypsinization first and then explant culture in a Leibovitz-15 medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum and 10% fish muscle extract. It was found that the CAM cells were very sensitive to trypsinization and needed to be sub-cultured at a low trypsin concentration of 0.0625% to be able to go through the crisis of spontaneous immortalization transformation, and afterward a total of five derivative cell strains were isolated from the original CAM cell line. This spontaneous immortalization transformation event was recorded successively at passages 44-47, beginning with a large-scale apoptosis and senescence and followed by mitosis arrest and re-activation, thus designated as cell strain CAM-44A, 44B, 45A, 44B, and 47A. Now both the CAM cell line and strains had been sub-cultured for more than 89 times and could be well cryopreserved in the growth medium containing 5% dimethylsulfoxide. Chromosome analysis and COI gene analysis had confirmed the grass goldfish origin of these CAM cells. Transfection potential analysis indicated that Lipofectamine LTX and Xfect were two suitable transfection reagents to be used in the gene delivery of CAM cells with a transfection efficiencies up to 11±6% and 8±3% in the CAM cell lines, respectively.

Experiment 2 also included dishes labelled as plant-based meat, revealing that vegetarians and vegans evaluated clean meat dishes considerably more negatively than plant-based dishes, an effect exacerbated among those higher in food technology neophobia. Finally, Experiment 3 demonstrated that safety concerns, but not naturalness concerns, partly explained why those higher in food technology neophobia evaluated clean meat dishes as less favorable.

The qualitative empirical study is based on 23 interviews with actors along the meat production chain. The analysis reveals that industry actors’ perceived barriers are highly complex. This complexity results from (1) multiple interactions among and between internal and external influencing factors and (2) the simultaneous existence of barriers that reinforce the status quo on the one hand and restrain the pursuit of sustainable production practices on the other hand. Based on these findings, opportunities for overcoming barriers are discussed in today's context. This study's contributions are twofold: First, the analysis complements previous research on barriers to sustainable meat production practices by detailing barriers and their interactions for actors along the entire meat production chain.

Replacing meat with non-meat protein sources is one strategy advocated to reduce meat intake. This narrative review aims to identify the drivers and inhibitors underlying replacing meat with non-meat protein sources in omnivores and flexitarians in developed countries. A systematic search was conducted in Scopus and Web of Science until April 2021. In total, twenty-three studies were included in this review examining personal, socio-cultural, and external factors. Factors including female gender, information on health and the environment, and lower price may act as drivers to replacing meat with non-meat protein sources. Factors including male gender, meat attachment, food neophobia, and lower situational appropriateness of consuming non-meat protein sources may act as inhibitors. Research is needed to establish the relevance of socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, religion, health status, food environment, and cooking skills. Future studies should prioritize standardizing the definitions of meat and non-meat protein replacements and examining factors across different consumer segments and types of non-meat protein sources. Thereby, the factors determining the replacement of meat with non-meat protein sources can be better elucidated, thus, facilitating the transition to a healthier and more sustainable diet.",consumer preference; environmental sustainability; food choice; meat replacement; non-meat protein source,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2021,13,10,,Nutrients,,2021-10-14,,2072-6643,,10.3390/nu13103602,34684603,PMC8537109,,"Division of Human Nutrition and Health, Wageningen University, Stippeneng 4, 6708 WE Wageningen, The Netherlands.",en,,,,,,,,,,,2021-11-12,2023-02-02

One such method that is often mentioned is switching to a diet less dependent on meat. However, such advice is often met with scepticism and reluctance from conventional meat consumers. But with the rise of companies making both plant-and fungi-based meat (PBM) and cellular meat (CBM) in recent years, the process of switching to a more sustainable diet has become a lot easier. For a country like India which, despite having around 34% vegetarians, is increasingly consuming more meat, meat alternatives are a promising option. This paper shall thus analyse the development and scope of meat alternatives such as PBM and CBM, their production, manufacture, driving forces and consumer attitudes from an Indian perspective. There shall further be an attempt to analyse their nutritional values vis-a-vis conventional meat, i.e., animal-based meat (ABM) products. The effects of the rise of such alternatives on both the planet and the population as a whole shall also be detailed. In addition, the future potential and upscaling of such processes to feed whole populations shall also be addressed.",,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2021,68,1,,BTTA Rev.,Institute of Chemical Technology (ICT),2021-10-06,,0300-9602,0067-9925,10.36664/bt/2021/v68i1/165753,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-11-12,2023-02-02

The mechanisms driving PCL degradation appear to be overall variably documented and investigated, despite the potentially significant influence that aspects such as synthesis, end-group chemistry, molecular weight, and crystallinity, both before and after melt processing, may have on the behavior of the polymer over time. In this review, we identify mechanisms of PCL degradation across a range of mainly biomedical applications, exploring the role of the polymer structure and form, radical interactions, temperature, pH, enzymatic activity, and cellular phagocytosis. We examine how polymer chemistry has been used to alter PCL degradation rates and mechanisms, and present cases where such manipulations may affect the applications of PCL. We also comprehensively discuss the literature assessing the degradation of PCL in vitro and in vivo, and present a summary of the correlations and trends between the data. Significantly, our analysis identifies currently undescribed trends in PCL degradation. Namely, we observe that molecular weight decreases at a consistent rate regardless of the initial value, and does so at a linear rate in vitro and an exponential rate in vivo. Both mechanical properties and mass loss are strongly influenced by construct geometry and environmental conditions. We further assess the current biomedical literature on the degradation of PCL copolymers and its composites. The formation of novel PCL copolymers or composites is often used to broaden the versatility and applicability of the polymer, although this approach is rarely explored beyond initial research. Novel biomaterials overall rarely emerge from research, with inherent issues such as the reproducibility of synthesis, manufacturing, or characterization methods and outcomes further impeding their translation. We conclude the review with a summary of the current state of the tailorability of PCL-based polymers and composites, and offer recommendations for the future research direction of the field.",Polycaprolactone; Degradation; Biocompatibility; Biomaterials; Scaffolds; Materials engineering,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2019,96,,1-20,Prog.

Electrospinning is one of the processing techniques often used for the fabrication of these nanofibrous structures and the combination of synthetic and natural polymers is often required to achieve optimal mechanical and physiochemical properties. Here, polycaprolactone (PCL) is selected as a synthetic polymer used for the fabrication of scaffolds, and the effect of protein addition on the final scaffolds' properties is studied. Collagen and gelatin were the proteins selected and two different concentrations were analyzed (2 and 4 wt/vol%). Different PCL/protein systems were prepared, and a structural, mechanical and functional characterization was performed. The influence of fiber alignment on the properties of the final scaffolds was assessed through morphological, mechanical and biological evaluations. A bioreactor was used to promote cell proliferation and differentiation within the scaffolds. The results revealed that protein addition produced a decrease in the fiber size of the membranes, an increase in their hydrophilicity, and a softening of their mechanical properties.

Conventional meat production accounts for a considerable amount of greenhouse gas emission, land and water usage, and energy consumption. Plant-based meat alternatives have been a cornerstone in the alternative protein market. In recent years, biomimicry of traditional meat products is the focus on the market. Animal-raised meat has still maintained its popularity as plant-based meat analogues (PBMA) fail to mimic or be better than conventional meat production. PBMA aims to replicate the aesthetic and chemical characteristics of a type of meat without the need of raising animals. Another alternative is the novel cultured meat or “lab-grown meat” that could provide a high protein source. Considerable developments are still needed to produce complex cultured meat products. Because of difficulties of replicating meat proteins in PBMA, a proposition is to use cultured meat components in PBMA.

With wholesale dietary change notoriously difficult to implement at scale, various new food analogues have emerged to serve as qualitatively similar (e.g. taste, texture) but lower environmental impact alternatives for existing foods, particularly animal protein. While new foods may have low environmental impacts, very little is known about how reliably new products drive the disadoption (permanently reduced or ceased consumption) of existing foods. Using simple models of the interplay between adoption levels, substitution ratios of new and existing foods, and different products targeted for replacement, we explore the role of food disadoption on the global warming potential of protein consumption by a theoretical human population. We show how counterintuitive changes to the total environmental impacts attributable to food consumption are plausible following widespread uptake of ‘sustainable’ new foods if they do not reliably drive the disadoption of existing high-impact alternatives. Greater empirical evidence of how effectively new foods drive the disadoption of their intended targets is needed to prevent mass development of alternatives that exacerbate the environmental impact of human diets.",,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2021,16,10,104022,Environ.

This study aimed at investigating the effects of grooved topography on the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into osteoblasts, adipocytes and myoblasts. A series of submicron-grooved polystyrene substrates with equal groove-to-ridge ratio but different width and depth (width/depth (nm): 450/100, 450/350, 900/100, and 900/550) were fabricated based on electron beam lithography and soft lithography techniques. Primary rat MSCs (rMSCs) were cultured on these substrates without induction for differentiation for 6 days, and then subjected to induction for osteogenesis, adipogenesis and myogenesis. While the alignment of rMSCs strongly complied with the direction of the grooves and increased with groove depths, cell attachment on day 1 (~1.5 × 10(4)/cm(2)) and cell proliferation after 6 days of culture (~5 × 10(4)/cm(2)) were not significantly affected by substrate types. Osteogenesis, indicated by alkaline phosphatase activities and calcium deposit, was not significantly modulated by the grooved substrates, compared with the flat control, suggesting that cell alignment may not determine osteoinduction of rMSCs. On the other hand, adipogenesis, indicated by lipid production, was significantly enhanced by the grooved substrates compared with the flat surface (P < 0.001). On the other hand, myogenesis, indicated by desmin and MHC staining, was enhanced by the grooves in a time- and groove size-dependent manner compared with the flat control.

Upon differentiation induction to the smooth muscle lineage, DFAT cell fibers self-assembled to coiled spring structures where the cells became circumferentially oriented. By changing the initial core-shell microfiber diameter, we demonstrated that the spring pitch and diameter could be controlled. 21 days after differentiation induction, the cell fibers contained high percentages of ASMA-positive and calponin-positive cells.

Thus, when scaling up, cell suspensions must be manually transferred from the culture flask to another vessel suitable for agitation, which increases the risk of contamination and human error. Ideally, the number of culture transfer steps should be kept to a minimum. The present study describes the fabrication of an ultrasonic suspension culture system that stirs cell suspensions with the use of acoustic streaming generated by ultrasound irradiation at a MHz frequency. This system was applied to 100-mL suspension cultures of Chinese hamster ovary cells?a volume ten-fold larger than that generally used. The cell proliferation rate in this system was 1.88/day when applying an input voltage of 40 V to the ultrasonic transducer, while that of the SSC was 1.14/day. Hence, the proposed method can extend the volume limit of static cell suspension cultures, thereby reducing the number of cell culture transfer steps.",,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2021,149,6,4180-4189,J.

Commercially viable cultured meat production likely requires proliferation bioreactors much larger than those used in the pharmaceutical industry today. However, most lab-scale process developments are carried out in spinner flasks that cannot be readily scaled-up using conventional, semi-empirical methods. We systematically investigated the hydrodynamics and mass transfer characteristics of a 250 mL spinner flask under 30−120 rpm stirring speeds and 50 or 100 mL filling volumes, as well as 0−30 g/L microcarriers, to facilitate scale-down experiment design hence the transfer of lab-generated knowledge to large scale bioreactors. It was found that meat cells are typically cultured under operating conditions that give a combination of <10 s mixing time and about 1 mW/kg energy dissipation rate, but with high dissolved oxygen concentrations. Computational fluid dynamics moelling was performed for both the spinner flask and a generic cell culture reactor of 20 m³ working volume. Simulations suggested that it might not be possible to reproduce the most favourable conditions in large scale reactors. In particular, even when operated at a stirring speed close to the Njs, the shear exerted by the impellers alone could cause cell detachment from microcarriers, while even more hydrodynamic stress is introduced via sparging.",Mixing; Mass transfer; Bioreactor; CFD; Cultured meat; Scaling-down; Scaling-up,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2021,167,,107864,Biochem.

The success of co-culture system was proved. In the co-cultured cells, slight lipid droplets were observed and appeared more slowly. The polykaryocytes fused into myotubes in co-cultured cells were less and relatively slow than that in solo myocytes. After fusion, the proliferation rate of co-cultured cells was higher than that in the solo-cultured muscle satellite cells (P < 0.01), and the duration were also longer. On day 5 and 10, the expression of the marker genes in earlier stage of cell differentiation (LPL and Myf5) were lower than those in the solo-cultured cells (P < 0.01) (except LPL gene at day 5).

Neonatal porcine muscle has the potential to yield both cell types for cell culture because it contains developing adipocytes and a high number of muscle satellite cells. Therefore, we modified a conventional collagenase-based procedure to digest neonatal porcine muscle and subsequently cultured the resultant muscle stromal-vascular (SV) cells on several substrata in basal and dexamethasone (DEX)-containing media. Developing myotubes and preadipocytes were present in muscle SV cell cultures on laminin substrata following seeding and plating with fetal bovine serum (FBS) with or without DEX. Myotube number was much higher (P < 0.05) on laminin substrata compared with all other substrata, whereas preadipocyte number in muscle SV cell cultures was independent of substrata, as we have shown previously. This approach can be used to establish co-cultures of differentiating adipocytes and myotubes from collagenase-digested neonatal pig muscle. Because the comparison is within the same culture dish, this method allows for a direct comparison of the responses of adipogenic and myogenic cells to growth and differentiation factors. For example, DEX did not alter myogenesis (i.e., 11 +/- 3 vs. 11 +/- 4 myotubes per unit area for control and DEX-treated cultures, respectively), but it has been shown to markedly increase preadipocyte number in muscle SV cell cultures.",,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,Sus scrofa,,2005,83,5,1010-1016,J.

In this study, we establish a new method by combining the mature adipocyte ceiling method and the transwell co-culture system. Mature intramuscular adipocyte (MIA) and muscle satellite cell (MSC) were obtained from digested pectoralis major, and MIAs were transformed into IMPs by dedifferentiation with ceiling culture. MSCs were then purified by differential adhesion for 2 h. The results by inverted-microscope observation, MTT assay, Oil Red O staining, and q-PCR revealed that the de-differentiated cells from MIA were identified as the IMPs, and had the same the cellular morphology, the capacity on differentiation, proliferation and passage with the abdominal fat preadipocytes (P > 0.05). The applicability of the obtained IMPs in co-cultured experiment with the MSC revealed that it could meet the requirements of the experimental study. Finally, a co-culture system of IMPs and MSCs was established using a transwell chamber. The co-cultured results indicated that MSCs in the proliferative stage tend to accelerate the differentiation of IMPs to induce more fat content in co-cultured IMPs than in single-culture IMPs (P < 0.05), in the non-proliferative stage, the results tend to show the opposite (P < 0.05). The mRNA levels of related genes significantly changed in accordance with the fat content in cells. The results strongly supported the view that the established co-culture system was effective and feasible.

It is considered as one of the richest sources of proteins. There is an increasing demand for meat worldwide. It may not be possible to fulfill this demand for meat in future. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find out the alternative resources for proteins requirement shortly. Clean meat production is one of the best methods to be adopted as an alternative to traditional meat. The word 'clean' signifies that we can procure meat from animals without its monstrous slaughtering. Hence, it is prepared by isolating a single cell and culturing them in controlled growth conditions and medium that mimic the in vivo condition. It is not a brand new technology, but the tools for developing clean meat that mimics real meat have been technologically advanced recently. Many companies have marketed clean meat products worldwide from last five years. And it has been observed that there are mixed responses for its acceptance by consumers. The main driving forces for clean meat production derives from the concerns over environment, animal welfare, public and consumer health aspects of animal production, use of antibiotics in the animal industries, and food security. Since it's an upcoming meat production technology, there are many hurdles and challenges like nutritional attributes, flavor, shape, and structure compared to real meat. It requires many skills and understanding of muscle stem cells' regeneration and their growth under optimized scale-up production conditions.

In this study, we attempted to transdifferentiate pig embryonic fibroblasts (PEFs) myogenically into skeletal muscle through overexpression of the pig MYOD1 gene and modulation of the FGF, TGF-β, WNT, and cAMP signaling pathways. RESULTS: The MYOD1 overexpression vector was constructed based on comparative sequence analysis, demonstrating that pig MYOD1 has evolutionarily conserved domains across various species. Although forced MYOD1 expression through these vectors triggered the expression of endogenous muscle markers, transdifferentiated muscle cells from fibroblasts were not observed. Therefore, various signaling molecules, including FGF2, SB431542, CHIR99021, and forskolin, along with MYOD1 overexpression were applied to enhance the myogenic reprogramming. The modified conditions led to the derivation of myotubes and activation of muscle markers in PEFs, as determined by qPCR and immunostaining. Notably, a sarcomere-like structure was observed, indicating that terminally differentiated skeletal muscle could be obtained from transdifferentiated cells. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we established a protocol for reprogramming MYOD1-overexpressing PEFs into the mature skeletal muscle using signaling molecules.

In this study, four HBOCs were evaluated: PEG-conjugated human hemoglobin (MP4), human hemoglobin (hHb), bovine hemoglobin (BvHb) and polymerized bovine hemoglobin (PolyBvHb). In addition, two types of convective flow in the HF extra capillary space (ECS) were considered in this study. Starling flow naturally occurs when both of the ECS ports are closed. If one of the ECS ports is open, forced convective flow through the ECS will occur due to the imposed pressure difference between the lumen and ECS. This type of flow is referred to as cross-flow in this work, since some of the fluid entering the HF lumen will pass across the HF membrane and exit via the open ECS port. In this work, we can predict the dissolved O(2) concentration profile as well as the O(2) transport flux in an individual HF of the bioreactor by solving the coupled momentum and mass transport equations. Our results show that supplementation of the cell culture media with HBOCs can dramatically enhance O(2) transport to the ECS (containing hepatocytes) and lead to the formation of an in vivo-like O(2) spectrum for the optimal culture of hepatocytes. However, both Starling flow and cross-flow have a very limited effect on O(2) transport in the ECS. Taken together, this work represents a novel predictive tool that can be used to design or analyze HF bioreactors that expose cultured cells to defined overall concentrations and gradients of O(2).",,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2009,102,6,1603-1612,Biotechnol.

Such gaseous enhancement often stimulates biomass production, yields of commercially-important cellular products and, for plant systems, the expression of totipotency. The recoverability, and hence recycleability, of otherwise expensive PFCs from aqueous culture medium makes their routine use commercially feasible. This paper gives an overview of the applications and benefits of using PFCs in microbial, animal and plant cell cultures, including both aerobic and anaerobic systems.

The work provides a proof of concept for the use of channelled scaffolds as both a means of media supply and the scaffold for myoblast expansion and differentiation.

Methods: Channelled PCL sheets were produced by employing sheet casting methods by phase inversion [4]. NaCl particles were used as a porogen and water as the non-solvent and to leach the porogen. C2C12s were cultured in media (DMEM + 10% FBS) on 2D flat sheets, and 3D rolled sheets with flow through the channels and recycling.

Results: The PCL sheets were porous and the channels were intact, as observed on SEM images. The PCL sheet demonstrated good mechanical properties such that they could be rolled without damage. Fibrin was used as a hydrogel to achieve high cell seeding within PCL porous sheets. Attachment and proliferation of C2C12s was tested in 2D before, and 3D after rolling. Proliferation of C2C12s on the scaffold inside a perfusion reactor was assessed using histological methods.

Each of these fabrication technologies feature specific advantages and limitations, so that a combination of different approaches opens new and otherwise unreachable opportunities for the fabrication of hierarchical cell-material constructs. Ongoing challenges such as vascularization, limited volume, and repeatability of tissue constructs at the resolution required to mimic natural tissue is most likely greater than what one manufacturing technology can overcome. Therefore, the combination of at least two different manufacturing technologies is seen as a clear and necessary emerging trend, especially within biofabrication. This hybrid approach allows more complex mechanics and discrete biomimetic structures to address mechanotransduction and chemotactic/haptotactic cues.

To achieve this, scaffolds act as delivery vectors or as cellular systems for drugs and cells; thereby, cellular material is able to colonize host cells sufficiently to meet up the requirements of regeneration and repair. This process is multi-stage and requires the development of various components to create the desired neo-tissue or organ. In several current TE strategies, biomaterials are essential components. While several polymers are established for their use as biomaterials, careful consideration of the cellular environment and interactions needed is required in selecting a polymer for a given application. Depending on this, scaffold materials can be of natural or synthetic origin, degradable or nondegradable. In this review, an overview of various natural and synthetic polymers and their possible composite scaffolds with their physicochemical properties including biocompatibility, biodegradability, morphology, mechanical strength, pore size, and porosity are discussed.

The process presented here allows the removal of the calcium alginate shell, after only 24 hours of culture, leading to stable and reproducible fibre shaped cellular constructs. With time of culture cells show to distribute preferentially to the surface of the fibre and display a uniform cellular orientation. Moreover, when cultured inside the fibres, murine bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells show the capacity to differentiate towards the osteoblastic lineage, under non-osteoinductive culture conditions.

Consistent with previous reports, we found that human dermal fibroblasts align parallel to free edges in partially constrained gels; in contrast to at least one report, fibroblasts in fully constrained gels remained randomly aligned independent of geometry. These experiments allowed us to distinguish between two possible mechanisms for such alignment. Mean orientations that followed the shape of the free edges and stronger alignment nearest the free edges in gels with a variety of geometries suggested that cells align parallel to a local free boundary rather than to local lines of tension.

After a day of static culture, 10 and 20. mg/ml collagen menisci were either clamped or unclamped and cultured for up to 8 weeks. Clamped menisci were anchored in culture trays throughout culture to mimic the native meniscus horn attachment sites, restrict contraction circumferentially, and encourage circumferential alignment. Clamped menisci retained their size and shape, and by 8 weeks developed circumferential and radial fiber organization that resembled native meniscus. Clamping also increased collagen accumulation and improved mechanical properties compared to unclamped menisci. Enhanced organization in clamped menisci was further reflected in the development of anisotropic tensile properties, with 2-3 fold higher circumferential moduli compared to radial moduli, a similar ratio to native meniscus. Ten and 20. mg/ml clamped menisci had similar levels of organization, with 20. mg/ml menisci producing larger diameter fibers and significantly better mechanical properties.

However, Matrigel is limited in its applicability to cellular biology, therapeutic cell manufacturing and drug discovery owing to its complex, ill-defined and variable composition. Variations in the mechanical and biochemical properties within a single batch of Matrigel - and between batches - have led to uncertainty in cell culture experiments and a lack of reproducibility. Moreover, Matrigel is not conducive to physical or biochemical manipulation, making it difficult to fine-tune the matrix to promote intended cell behaviours and achieve specific biological outcomes. Recent advances in synthetic scaffolds have led to the development of xenogenic-free, chemically defined, highly tunable and reproducible alternatives. In this Review, we assess the applications of Matrigel in cell culture, regenerative medicine and organoid assembly, detailing the limitations of Matrigel and highlighting synthetic scaffold alternatives that have shown equivalent or superior results. Additionally, we discuss the hurdles that are limiting a full transition from Matrigel to synthetic scaffolds and provide a brief perspective on the future directions of synthetic scaffolds for cell culture applications.",,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2020,5,7,539-551,Nat Rev Mater,,2020-07,,2058-8437,,10.1038/s41578-020-0199-8,32953138,PMC7500703,,"Department of Surgery, University of Wisconsin-Madison, WI, USA.

Yet, and despite the predominantly nonplanar geometry of these environments, the impact of tissue-size (milliscale) curvature on cell behavior is largely overlooked or underestimated. This study explores how concave, hemicylinder-shaped surfaces 3-50 mm in diameter affect the migration, proliferation, orientation, and differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts. Notably, these milliscale cues significantly affect cell responses compared with planar substrates, with myoblasts grown on surfaces 7.5-15 mm in diameter showing prevalent migration and alignment parallel to the curvature axis. Moreover, surfaces within this curvature range promote myoblast differentiation and the formation of denser, more compact tissues comprising highly oriented multinucleated myotubes. Based on the similarity of effects, it is further proposed that myoblast susceptibility to substrate curvature depends on mechanotransduction signaling. This model thus supports the notion that cellular responses to substrate curvature and compliance share the same molecular pathways and that control of cell behavior can be achieved via modulation of either individual parameter or in combination. This correlation is relevant for elucidating how muscle tissue forms and heals, as well as for designing better biomaterials and more appropriate cell-surface interfaces.",cell alignment; muscle differentiation; myoblasts; self-organization; surface curvature,"Cultivated Meat Library,Papers by GFI grantees,Deep dive: Cultivated meat scaffolding part B",,,C2C12,,,2021,5,4,e2000280,Adv Biol (Weinh),"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",2021-04,,2701-0198,2701-0198,10.1002/adbi.202000280,33852180,,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"Tissue Engineering Lab Biosciences Institute, Newcastle University, International Centre for Life, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1 3BZ, UK.

Respondents were randomly allocated to treatments that varied in the presence/absence of brands and information about the competing alternatives. Results from random parameter logit models indicate that, holding prices constant and conditional on choosing a food product, 72% chose farm-raised beef and 28% chose one of the alternatives: 16% plant-based (pea protein) meat alternative, 7% plant-based (animal-like protein) meat alternative, and 5% lab-grown meat.

Even if plant- and lab-grown alternatives experienced significant (e.g., 50%) price reductions, farm-raised beef maintains the majority market share. Vegetarians, males, younger, and more highly educated individuals tend to have relatively stronger preferences for the plant- and lab-grown alternatives relative to farm-raised beef.

Despite the bovine experimental model being widely used in experiments in vivo and in vitro, only a limited amount of information regarding bovine MSCs is available. The aim of this study was to isolate and induce the multilineage mesenchymal differentiation of bovine MSCs, thereby initiating further research on these cells. Bovine MSCs were isolated from eight calves, and osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic differentiation was induced by using a combination of previously reported protocols for other species. The level of differentiation was evaluated by histological examination and by analyzing the expression of tissue-specific genes by a quantitative ""real time"" reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction technique. Following osteoinduction, the isolated fibroblast-like cells transformed into cuboidal cells and formed alkaline-phosphatase-positive colonies; during differentiation, these colonies transformed into mineralized nodules. In addition, osteogenesis was followed by osteocalcin and collagen type I mRNA expression. Chondrogenesis was confirmed by the demonstration of collagen type II, aggrecan, and sox9 mRNA expression in the cells stimulated by transforming growth factor beta1 in monolayer culture. After being cultured in an adipogenesis-inducing medium, the MSCs responded by the accumulation of lipid vacuoles and the expression of adipocyte-specific genes.

This quality makes MSCs good candidates for use in cell therapy. MSCs can be isolated from a variety of tissues including bone marrow and adipose tissue, which are the most common sources of these cells. However, MSCs can also be isolated from peripheral blood. Sheep has been proposed as an ideal model for biomedical studies including those of orthopaedics and transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). The aim of this work was to advance these studies by investigating the possibility of MSC isolation from ovine peripheral blood (oPB-MSCs) and by subsequently characterizing there in vitro properties. RESULTS: Plastic-adherent fibroblast-like cells were obtained from the mononuclear fraction of blood samples. These cells were analysed for their proliferative and differentiation potential into adipocytes, osteoblasts and chondrocytes, as well as for the gene expression of cell surface markers. The isolated cells expressed transcripts for markers CD29, CD73 and CD90, but failed to express the haematopoietic marker CD45 and expressed only low levels of CD105. The expression of CD34 was variable. The differentiation potential of this cell population was evaluated using specific differentiation media. Although the ability of the cultures derived from different animals to differentiate into adipocytes, osteoblasts and chondrocytes was heterogeneous, we confirmed this feature using specific staining and analysing the gene expression of differentiation markers. Finally, we tested the ability of oPB-MSCs to transdifferentiate into neuronal-like cells. Morphological changes were observed after 24-hour culture in neurogenic media, and the transcript levels of the neurogenic markers increased during the prolonged induction period. Moreover, oPB-MSCs expressed the cellular prion protein gene (PRNP), which was up-regulated during neurogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: This study describes for the first time the isolation and characterization of oPB-MSCs. Albeit some variability was observed between animals, these cells retained their capacity to differentiate into mesenchymal lineages and to transdifferentiate into neuron-like cells in vitro. Therefore, oPB-MSCs could serve as a valuable tool for biomedical research in fields including orthopaedics or prion diseases.",,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,Ovis aries,,2012,8,,169,BMC Vet.

Understanding the clinical potential of MSCs may require their use in preclinical large-animal models, such as pigs. The objectives of the present study were 1) to establish porcine MSC (pMSC) cultures; 2) to optimize in vitro pMSC culture conditions, 3) to investigate whether pMSCs are amenable to genetic manipulation, and 4) to determine pMSC reprogramming potential using somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). The pMSCs isolated from bone marrow grew, attached to plastic with a fibroblast-like morphology, and expressed the mesenchymal surface marker THY1 but not the hematopoietic marker ITGAM. Furthermore, pMSCs underwent lipogenic, chondrogenic, and osteogenic differentiation when exposed to specific inducing conditions. The pMSCs grew well in a variety of media, and proliferative capacity was enhanced by culture under low oxygen atmosphere. Transient transduction of pMSCs and isogenic skin fibroblasts (SFs) with a human adenovirus carrying the gene for green fluorescent protein (GFP; Ad5-F35eGFP) resulted in more pMSCs expressing GFP compared with SFs. Cell lines with stable genetic modifications and extended expression of transgene were obtained when pMSCs were transfected with a plasmid containing the GFP gene. Infection of pMSC and SF cell lines by an adeno-associated virus resulted in approximately 12% transgenic cells, which formed transgenic clonal lines after propagation as single cells. The pMSCs can be expanded in vitro and used as nuclear donors to produce SCNT embryos. Thus, pMSCs are an attractive cell type for large-animal autologous and allogenic cell therapy models and for SCNT transgenesis.",,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,Sus scrofa,,2006,74,1,46-57,Biol.

We show that the combination of activin A, fibroblast growth factor and the Wnt inhibitor XAV939 (AFX) supports establishment and continuous expansion of pluripotent stem cell lines from porcine, ovine and bovine embryos. Germ layer differentiation was evident in teratomas and readily induced in vitro. Global transcriptome analyses highlighted commonality in transcription factor expression across the three species, while global comparison with porcine embryo stages showed proximity to bilaminar disc epiblast. Clonal genetic manipulation and gene targeting were exemplified in porcine stem cells. We further demonstrated that genetically modified AFX stem cells gave rise to cloned porcine foetuses by nuclear transfer.

Specifically, it reviews state-of-the-art bioprocess technologies, current limitations, and opportunities for research across four domains: cell line development, cell culture media, scaffolding, and bioreactors. This also includes exploring innovations to make cultured meat a viable protein alternative across numerous key performance indicators and for specific applications where traditional livestock is not an option (e.g., local production, space exploration). The paper explores tradeoffs between production scale, product quality, production cost, and footprint over different time horizons. Finally, a discussion explores various factors that may impact the ability to successfully scale and market cultured meat products: social acceptance, environmental tradeoffs, regulatory guidance, and public health benefits.

Consumption of meat in India is projected to rise with an increase in consumer incomes. Hence, novel alternative proteins, including cultured meat (CM) and plant-based meat (PBM), are being developed to satisfy the demand for meat-derived proteins in the diet. This involves the creation of novel PBM/CM products with a similar taste and texture as conventional animal meat with tailor-made nutritional attributes. In this article, we provide critical insights into the technical and business aspects of relevance to production and sustainability encountered by the Indian CM industry at a series of stages that can be termed the CM value chain comprising upstream and downstream processes.

This overview aims to show the current technological developments for the production of CM, starting with the tissue engineering used to collect, grow and differentiate the cells, and also the characteristics of matrixes, culture media, types of bioreactors and techniques employed for cell cultivation. In addition, bioeconomy and sustainability issues are discussed, as well as social aspects and policy regulation. Furthermore, the fast growing market is presented, starting with the first meat ball in 2016, passing through some examples of recent funding and operating companies and start-ups, the continuous efforts to lower production costs, besides the most recent patented processes. Finally, and in the light of recent developments, future challenges and expectations for the future of CM are discussed, such as tissue engineering bottlenecks, bioreactor design optimization and public acceptance issues.

Derivation of bovine pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) can be applied in drug selecting and human disease modeling and facilitated agriculture-related applications such as production of genetically excellent cattle by gene editing. Extended PSCs (EPSCs), capable of differentiating into embryonic and extraembryonic parts, have been generated in mouse, human, and pig. Whether bovine EPSCs could be generated, and their chimeric competency remains unclear. This study focused on derivation of bovine EPSCs using LCDM medium and exploring the characteristics of EPSCs among different species, including bovine, mouse, and human EPSCs. Here, using LCDM medium (consisting of hLIF, CHIR99021, (S)-(+)-dimethindene maleate, and minocycline hydrochloride) enables the derivation of bovine EPSCs from induced PSCs (iPSCs) and bovine fetal fibroblasts (BFF) with stable morphology, pluripotent marker expression, and in vitro differentiation ability. Notably, bovine EPSCs exhibited interspecies chimeric contribution to embryonic and extraembryonic tissues in pre-implantation blastocysts and postimplantation bovine-mouse chimeras. Transcriptome analysis revealed the unique molecular characteristics of bovine EPSCs compared with iPSCs. The similarities and differences in molecular features across bovine, human, and mouse EPSCs were also described by transcriptome analysis. Taken together, the LCDM culture system containing chemical cocktails can be used for the establishment and long-term passaging of bovine EPSCs with embryonic and extraembryonic potency in bovine-mouse chimeras. Our findings lay the foundation of generating PSCs in domestic animals and open avenues for basic and applied research in biology, medicine, and agriculture.

Following adipogenic differentiation, the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα) were much higher (239.4±84.1% and 310.7±138.4%, respectively, P<0.05) in high adipogenic cells. Over-expression of Zfp423 in stromal vascular cells and cloned low adipogenic cells dramatically increased their adipogenic differentiation, accompanied with the inhibition of TGF-β expression. Zfp423 knockdown by shRNA in high adipogenic cells largely prevented their adipogenic differentiation. The differential regulation of Zfp423 and TGF-β between low and high adipogenic cells is associated with the DNA methylation in their promoters. In conclusion, data show that Zfp423 is a critical regulator of adipogenesis in stromal vascular cells of bovine muscle, and Zfp423 may provide a molecular target for enhancing intramuscular adipogenesis and marbling in beef cattle.",,Cultivated Meat Library,,bovine_SV_HA_Huang,,Bos taurus,,2012,7,10,e47496,PLoS One,,2012-10-10,,1932-6203,,10.1371/journal.pone.0047496,23071815,PMC3468566,,"Developmental Biology Group, Department of Animal Science, University of Wyoming, Laramie, WY, USA.",en,,,,,,,,,,,2021-12-15,2023-02-10

These ECM layers are hypothesized to serve important functional roles within muscle, influencing passive mechanics, providing avenues for force transmission, and influencing dynamic shape changes during contraction. The morphology of the skeletal muscle ECM is well described in mammals and birds; however, ECM morphology in other vertebrate groups including amphibians, fish, and reptiles remains largely unexamined. It remains unclear whether a multilayered ECM is a common feature of vertebrate skeletal muscle, and whether functional roles attributed to the ECM should be considered in mechanical analyses of non-mammalian and non-avian muscle. To explore the prevalence of a multilayered ECM, we used a cell maceration and scanning electron microscopy technique to visualize the organization of ECM collagen in muscle from six vertebrates: bullfrogs (Lithobates catesbeianus), turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo), alligators (Alligator mississippiensis), cane toads (Rhinella marina), laboratory mice (Mus musculus), and carp (Cyprinus carpio). All muscles studied contained a collagen-reinforced ECM with multiple morphologically distinct layers. An endomysium surrounding muscle fibers was apparent in all samples. A perimysium surrounding groups of muscle fibers was apparent in all but carp epaxial muscle; a muscle anatomically, functionally, and phylogenetically distinct from the others studied. An epimysium was apparent in all samples taken at the muscle periphery. These findings show that a multilayered ECM is a common feature of vertebrate muscle and suggest that a functionally relevant ECM should be considered in mechanical models of vertebrate muscle generally. It remains unclear whether cross-species variations in ECM architecture are the result of phylogenetic, anatomical, or functional differences, but understanding the influence of such variation on muscle mechanics may prove a fruitful area for future research.",collagen; connective tissue; fascia,"PISCES/ATLAS,Cultivated Meat Library,Deep dive: Cultivated meat end products",,,,"Cyprinus carpio,Meleagris gallopavo",,2020,281,2,160-169,J.

In this article we explore the opportunities and obstacles in introducing cell-based seafood as a new related industry niche in the region through coevolution with the established salmon farming industry. Introducing a new industry niche to this region could contribute to a comprehensive renewal of existing seafood-related activity and represent a major step towards sustainable seafood production. Cell-based seafood may eliminate sea lice, escapee and excess nutrient impacts on the surroundings by enabling highly controlled and contained seafood production. We found that coevolution between the cell-based seafood sector and the salmon industry in the Bergen region will be difficult to materialize at the present time. There are two main explanations. First, coevolution is challenging when the dominant path (i.e., salmon farming) is in a stable state. High profitability and a stable state mean that this industry absorbs investors, technology suppliers and research milieus that may otherwise have been on the lookout for alternatives and supplementary business opportunities. It also means that incumbents within the dominant path will not be looking for diversification alternatives. Secondly, there are distinct differences between the two industry paths when it comes to knowledge base, innovation mode and geographical configurations, making actor mobility, knowledge spillovers and resource sharing between the two industry paths challenging. We also find that coevolution may occur in the future through industrial convergent evolution mechanisms of downstream value chains as the cell-based seafood industry matures.",Salmon farming cell-based seafood co-evolution path dependent Bergen region innovation,"PISCES/ATLAS,Cultivated Meat Library",,,,,,2022,135,,104855,Mar.

However, being in nascent stage, CM technology is facing various limitations. Fermentation, on the other hand, has existed for centuries and is traditionally associated with textural and flavour enhancements in food. The recent developments in the fermentation technology have garnered increased interest among the players in the alternative protein sector. Scope and approach This paper discusses how the incorporation of fermentation technology, especially biomass and precision fermentation, into the manufacturing process of CM can potentially alleviate or even eliminate some of its limitations. We have also discussed the technology and product focus and geographical spread of companies in the fermentation and CM space. Key findings and conclusions The use of fermentation to produce food ingredients and the industry's fast growth reflects its applicability to CM or alternative protein industries. As the CM industry develops, fermentation continues to engage in essential roles in the CM production process through the provision of natural food-safe ingredients, which could potentially enhance the taste, texture, post-production nutrition and shelf life of the product. Production of ingredients may be derived from engineered metabolic pathways or biomass fermentation with mycelial and macrofungal species. A sizeable proportion of fermentation companies are yielding ingredients of relevance to the CM space.

Recent innovations in food production technologies (“food frontiers”) claim to offer gains in ecological sustainability and global food security, thereby transitioning our food system toward a more sustainable future. Yet, scientific evidence to support these claims has not been critically reviewed for several high-profile innovations. Scope and approach In this paper, we undertake a critical review of the literature on five food frontiers: cellular agriculture, climate-driven northern agricultural expansion (NAE), controlled environment agriculture (CEA), entomophagy, and seaweed aquaculture. We estimate the feasibility of each frontier’s widespread implementation by 2050 and their potential positive impacts on food system sustainability. We highlight uncertainty regarding ecological tradeoffs and future production potential in the literature, research gaps, and policy pathways that may maximize the benefits of these food frontiers. Key findings and conclusions Entomophagy, cellular agriculture, CEA, and seaweed aquaculture have similar positive impact values. Yet, CEA appears to be the most feasible technology to implement at scale. The mixed potential impacts of NAE suggest that such expansion poses multiple risks to the global food system. Standardized approaches to modeling environmental parameters in life cycle analyses are required, so that predicted impacts can be reasonably compared within and among these bodies of literature. Further critical social scientific engagement is needed to better understand the political and institutional frameworks in which these food frontiers will be implemented.",Entomophagy; Controlled environment agriculture; Northern agriculture expansion; Cultured protein; Seaweed aquaculture; Global food security; Cellular agriculture,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2021,,,,Trends Food Sci.

Experimental measurements of the power consumption, mixing time, and microparticles suspension dynamics were carried out at the 1 L scale in an unbaffled reactor and the performance compared with two conventional up-pumping axial flow impellers, namely the 3-Blade segment (3BS, also called “elephant ear”) and marine impeller. In addition, the impeller flow number and pumping efficiency were obtained from Particle Image Velocimetry experiments. The Bach impeller exhibited a low power number of NP=0.36 and showed it can generate a uniform suspension of microcarriers even at relatively low impeller speeds (from N=25–30 rpm onwards). The impeller was found to effectively mix the reactor volume within tM=25 s at N>50 rpm (i.e. NtM=37±5) at a higher clearance when it was mounted closer to the free surface, C/T>0.5, while minimally affecting its suspension capabilities. Lastly, the Bach impeller displaced more fluid than the marine impeller and roughly an equal amount to the 3BS impeller, suggesting that the novel impeller can successfully be used for STR processes in the (bio)chemical engineering industry where low power inputs, but high mixing and particle suspension efficiencies are sought.","Impeller design; Stirred-tank reactors; Mixing, suspension dynamics; Power consumption",Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2021,,,117263,Chem.

We investigate the roles of Hippo-YAP signaling, which is important regulators in response to cell contact inhibition. Interestingly, abundant but not functional YAP proteins are accumulated in MuSCs seeded at high density. When treated with lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), the activator of YAP, porcine MuSCs exhibit increased proliferation and elevated differentiation potential compared with control cells.

Naming and labelling IVM can have significant implications and consequences for consumers? acceptance of this new product as well as for future labelling policies. We provide, for the first time, information on how the use of different terms (i.e., ?cultured?, ?lab-grown? and ?artificial?) shapes US consumers? preferences and marginal willingness to pay for IVM. Using a choice experiment involving chicken meat products that vary across four attributes (i.e., production method, carbon trust label, antibiotics use and price), our results show that consumers prefer chicken meat produced through the conventional production method and tend to generally reject IVM. However, the term ?cultured? is less disliked than the terms ?lab-grown? and ?artificial?, and ?artificial? is less disliked than ?lab-grown?. Results also indicate that consumers? valuations are heterogeneous over differing consumer attitudes. Our findings provide insights into the psychology of consumers? level of acceptance and attitudes, which can be useful in communicating the nature of the IVM to the public.

The awareness of carbon emissions linked to livestock and ethical concerns have triggered interest in more sustainable meat alternatives, among which cultured meat (also known as laboratory grown meat) is a recent entry. Like any new food, the ultimate success of cultured meat depends on consumer acceptance. This study analyses the peer-reviewed literature on consumer attitudes towards cultured meat to synthesize the existing evidence and identify priorities for future research. A systematic literature review was undertaken using the Web of Science, Science Direct and Scopus databases over 2008-2020, resulting in a final number of 43 articles meeting our selection criteria. The most important factors influencing consumer acceptance/rejection of cultured meat include public awareness, perceived naturalness, and food-related risk perception. Ethical and environmental concerns prompted consumers to be willing to pay a premium price for purchasing meat substitutes, but not necessarily cultured meat. Also, food neophobia and uncertainties about safety and health seem to be important barriers to uptake of this technology. Availability of other alternatives such as plant-based meat substitutes and product features, such as price and sensory appeal, are considered determinants of consumer reception of this technology. The effect of demographic factors is mixed. More research on the interrelationships between livestock production, food security, and alternative meat products is recommended.",Acceptance; Clean meat; In-vitro; Lab-grown meat; Systematic review; Consumer attitudes,"Cultivated Meat Library,Deep dive: Cultivated meat end products",,,,,,2021,170,,105829,Appetite,,2021-12-01,,0195-6663,1095-8304,10.1016/j.appet.2021.105829,34863794,,,"Novia University of Applied Sciences, Department of Bioeconomics, 10600, Tammisaari, Finland.

To this point, no research has looked explicitly at a counter-messaging approach, whereby problems of conventional meat production are leveraged to make the case for cultured meat. This study employs a 3x1 randomized experimental design with a sample of 302 British adults where participants are provided one of two differently focused counter-messages (animal welfare or environmental impact) or a control text. The study utilizes two repeated measures (before and after information provision) to examine the change in acceptance and investigate related informational effects. Though we find the focus of counter-messaging makes no difference, such an approach does generally promote consumer acceptance. Whereas acceptance of cultured meat is higher among men, younger consumers, and those who eat meat more often, change in acceptance is predicted by perceived consumer effectiveness and, marginally, lack of prior knowledge. By demonstrating the potential of a counter-messaging approach and offering a first examination of determinants of change in acceptance, this research should prove useful for researchers, policymakers, and proponents planning for the ongoing development and marketing of cultured meat.",Cultured meat; Counter-messaging; Informational effects; Acceptance; Consumer attitudes,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2022,97,,104485,Food Qual.

The study also aimed to determine how well subjective consumer evaluations corresponded with objective evaluations based on life cycle assessments and nutrient profiling. Results show that most participants did not assume that meat substitutes are automatically healthier and more environmentally friendly just because they are meat-free. Participants did not evaluate meat substitute products as more environmentally friendly than meat or consider them a healthier option. Compared to traditional foods like meat, fish and cheese, meat substitutes were also evaluated as less natural. Furthermore, strong correlations were found between participants’ perceptions of environmental friendliness, naturalness and healthiness, although objective evaluations of these attributes did not correlate.

This study aimed: 1. to compare the efficacy of different informative claims in improving attitude towards CM; 2. to verify the effect of previously studied variables on attitude towards CM. Four information types were compared (human safety; animal welfare; environmental impact; no additional information: control), each envisaging two additional claims (‘Antibiotic-free’ and ‘Pathogen- and zoonosis-free’ for human safety; ‘No animal breeding’ and ‘No animal slaughtering’ for animal welfare; ‘82–96% reduction of water consumption’ and ‘99% reduction of soil usage’ for environmental impact). The response variables were favour towards CM, willingness to try, willingness to purchase, and willingness to substitute traditional meat with CM. Data from 603 participants (61% females, 15–80 years old) randomly assigned to four blocks, each corresponding to one type of information, were analysed. Participants were uniform among blocks in terms of socio-demographic data, frequency of consumption of traditional meat, previous knowledge of CM, food neophobia, and disgust sensitivity. The type of information given to respondents improved favour and willingness to substitute compared to the control, without differences across blocks. The effects of the additional claims were comparable. Environmental claims unified respondents, while human safety and animal welfare claims were divisive for sex and age groups. Favour, willingness to try, willingness to purchase, and willingness to substitute were positively correlated (r 0.38–0.72) but the weak correlation between willingness to try and willingness to substitute indicates that being curious may not imply the modification of actual behaviour (traditional meat substitution). Response variables seemed not to be interchangeable. Females showed higher willingness to substitute CM to conventional meat if informed with claims related to human safety. Youngsters (under ’30 years old), who are plausibly the real future target, showed higher favour towards CM if provided with information related to animal welfare and human safety.

In in vivo settings, extracellular matrix (ECM) ensures substrates and scaffolds are provided for cells. The ECM of skeletal muscle (SM) maintains tissue elasticity, creates adhesion points for cells, provides a three-dimensional (3D) environment, and regulates biological processes. Consequently, creating mimics of native ECM is a difficult task. Animal-derived polymers like collagen are often regarded as the gold standard for producing scaffolds with ECM-like properties.

In addition, transplantation studies using pig pluripotent stem (PS) cell derivatives may serve as a testbed for safety and efficacy prior to human trials. Recently, it has been shown that mouse and human PS cells cultured in LCDM (recombinant human LIF, CHIR 99021, (S)-(+)-dimethindene maleate, minocycline hydrochloride) medium exhibited extended developmental potential (designated as extended pluripotent stem cells, or EPS cells), which could generate both embryonic and extraembryonic tissues in chimeric mouse conceptus. Whether stable pig induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells can be generated in LCDM medium and their chimeric competency remains unknown. METHODS: iPS cells were generated by infecting pig pericytes (PC) and embryonic fibroblasts (PEFs) with a retroviral vector encoding Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and cMyc reprogramming factors and subsequently cultured in a modified LCDM medium. The pluripotency of PC-iPS and PEF-iPS cells was characterized by examining the expression of pluripotency-related transcription factors and surface markers, transcriptome analysis, and in vitro and in vivo differentiation capabilities. Chimeric contribution of PC-iPS cells to mouse and pig conceptus was also evaluated with fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, and PCR analysis. RESULTS: In this study, using a modified version of the LCDM medium, we successfully generated iPS cells from both PCs and PEFs. Both PC-iPS and PEF-iPS cells maintained the stable ""dome-shaped"" morphology and genome stability after long-term culture. The immunocytochemistry analyses revealed that both PC-iPS and PEF-iPS cells expressed OCT4, SOX2, and SALL4, but only PC-iPS cells expressed NANOG and TRA-1-81 (faint). PC-iPS and PEF-iPS cells could be differentiated into cell derivatives of all three primary germ layers in vitro. The transcriptome analysis showed that PEF-iPS and PC-iPS cells clustered with pig ICM, Heatmap and volcano plot showed that there were 1475 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between PC-iPS and PEF-iPS cells (adjusted p value < 0.1), and the numbers of upregulated genes and downregulated genes in PC-iPS cells were 755 and 720, respectively. Upregulated genes were enriched with GO terms including regulation of stem cell differentiation, proliferation, development, and maintenance. And KEGG pathway enrichment in upregulated genes revealed Wnt, Jak-STAT, TGF-β, P53, and MAPK stem cell signaling pathways. Fluorescence microscopy and genomic PCR analyses using pig mtDNA-specific and GFP primers showed that the PC-iPS cell derivatives could be detected in both mouse and pig pre-implantation blastocysts and post-implantation conceptuses. Quantitative analysis via flow cytometry revealed that the chimeric contribution of pig PC-iPS cells in mouse conceptus was up to 0.04%. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that stable iPS cells could be generated in LCDM medium, which could give rise to both embryonic and extraembryonic cells in vivo. However, the efficiency and level of chimeric contribution of pig LCDM-iPS cells were found low.",Chimera; EPS cells; Extended pluripotency; Pig iPS cells,Cultivated Meat Library,,"PC-iPS_Xu,PEF-iPS_Xu",,Sus scrofa,,2019,10,1,193,Stem Cell Res.

The objective was to derive sheep induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), as an alternative pluripotent cell type to ESCs, from sheep fibroblasts by ectopic expression of heterologous transcription factors OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and cMYC. Sheep fibroblasts were infected with pantropic retroviruses coding the four transcription factors and reprogrammed to pluripotency at a rate of 0.002%. The sheep iPSCs (siPSCs) reactivated endogenous OCT4 and SOX2 genes assessed by qRT-PCR and immuno-cytochemistry, retained normal karyotyping, and more importantly, concurrently silenced all exogenous transgenes. The siPSCs were enzymatically dissociated to single cells, making them amenable to efficient transfection and fluorescent-activated cell sorting techniques. Further, the siPSCs differentiated in vitro to form embryoid bodies, and in vivo to form robust teratomas, containing cells representative of the three germ layers. Moreover, when injected into diploid or tetraploid sheep embryos, siPSCs contributed to the inner cell mass of resulting blastocysts, suggesting true pluripotential. These reprogrammed siPSCs may constitute a robust pluripotent alternative to elusive sheep ESCs, with great potential for use in agriculture and pharmaceutical biotechnology.",,Cultivated Meat Library,,siPSC_Liu,,Ovis aries,,2012,77,2,338-46.e1,Theriogenology,,2012-01-15,,0093-691X,1879-3231,10.1016/j.theriogenology.2011.08.006,21958637,,,"Centre for Reproduction and Development, Monash Institute of Medical Research, Monash University, Clayton, VIC 3168, Australia.",en,,,,,,,,,,,2022-01-03,2022-08-26

Although ESC have been established from chicken, it is very difficult to obtain enough embryos for isolation of stem cells for avian conservation in most wild birds. Therefore, the high feasibility of obtaining the pluripotent cell is most important in avian conservation studies. In this study, we generated induced pluripotent stem cell-like cells (iPSLC) from avian Feather Follicular cells (FFC). Avian FFC are one of the most easily accessible cell sources in most avian species, and their reprogramming into pluripotent stem cells can be an alternative system for preservation of avian species. Intriguingly, FFC had mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC)-like characteristics with regard to gene expression, protein expression, and adipocyte differentiation. Subsequently, we attempted to generate iPSLC from FFC using retroviral vectors. The FFC-iPSLC can proliferate with the stem pluripotent property and differentiate into several types of cells in vitro. Our results suggest that chicken FFC are an alternative cell source for avian cell reprogramming into pluripotent stem cells. This experimental strategy should be useful for conservation and restoration of endangered or high-value avian species without sacrificing embryos.",,Cultivated Meat Library,,Chicken_FFC-iPSLC_Kim,,Gallus gallus,,2017,95,8,3479-3486,J.

The mESCs (mouse embryonic stem cells) can contribute to both somatic and germinal lineages once re-injected into a recipient embryo at the blastocyst stage. In avian species, chicken embryonic stem cells (cESCs) have been isolated from the in vitro culture of early chicken blastodermal cells (cBCs) taken from stage X embryo (EG&K) These cESCs can be maintained under specific culture conditions and have been characterized on the basis of their morphology, biochemical features, in vitro differentiation potentialities and in vivo morphogenetic properties. The relationship between these cESCs and some of the chicken germ cells identified and grown under specific culture conditions are still under debate, in particular with the identification of the Cvh gene as a key factor for germ cell determination. Moreover, by cloning the avian homologue of the Oct4 mammalian gene, we have demonstrated that this gene, as well as the chicken Nanog gene, was involved in the characterization and maintenance of the chicken pluripotency.

CaMKII activation results in myotube growth via fusion with mononucleated myoblasts at a fusogenic synapse. Mechanistically, CaMKII interacts with and regulates MYMK and Rac1, and CaMKIIδ/γ knockout mice exhibit smaller regenerated myofibers following injury. In addition, the expression of a dominant negative CaMKII inhibits the formation of large multinucleated myotubes.

Current protocols induce myogenic differentiation in vitro through serum starvation, that is, an abrupt reduction in serum concentration. Here we used RNA sequencing to investigate the transcriptomic remodelling of bovine satellite cells during myogenic differentiation induced by serum starvation. We characterized canonical myogenic gene expression, and identified surface receptors upregulated during the early phase of differentiation, including IGF1R, TFRC and LPAR1. Supplementation of ligands to these receptors enabled the formulation of a chemically defined media that induced differentiation in the absence of serum starvation and/or transgene expression. Serum-free myogenic differentiation was of similar extent to that induced by serum starvation, as evaluated by transcriptome analysis, protein expression and the presence of a functional contractile apparatus. Moreover, the serum-free differentiation media supported the fabrication of three-dimensional bioartificial muscle constructs, demonstrating its suitability for cultured beef production. Bovine satellite cells undergoing myogenic differentiation in a chemically defined, serum-free medium are comparable to those undergoing serum starvation—demonstrating the suitability of this formulation for cultured meat production.",,"Cultivated Meat Library,Cultivated Meat 101",Not CC-licensed,,,Bos taurus,,2022,,,1-12,Nature Food,Nature Publishing Group,2022-01-13,,2662-1355,2662-1355,10.1038/s43016-021-00419-1,,,,,en,,,,,,,,,,,2022-01-27,2023-02-10

MSC-CM contains growth factors and cytokines that control many cellular responses during development and regeneration. Traditional 2D cell culture (2DCC) has previously been used to generate MSC-CM while evidence has proved that the physiological and biological behaviors of cells in 2DCC are significantly different from those in 3D cell culture (3DCC). Therefore, the objective is to compare the content of MSC-CM generated from traditional 2DCC and 3DCC using a 3D scaffold. METHODS: Adipose tissue-derived MSCs (AT-MSCs) were isolated from four donors (N = 4) and characterized according to the criteria stipulated by the International Society for Cell Therapy (ISCT). MSCs at passage 3 were grown in traditional 2DCC until 70% confluence and MSC-CM were collected at 24, 48, and 94 h. On the other hand, MSCs at passage 3 were grown on a polystyrene scaffold for 10 days to generate a 3D model of MSCs, and then MSC-CM was collected at 24, 48, and 94 h. MSC-CM from both 2DCC and 3DCC were analyzed for protein content using ELISA. Haematoxylin eosin (HE) staining and immunofluorescence (IF) were used to characterize the 3DCC of MSCs. RESULTS: MSCs from 2DCC were fibroblast like cells, and flow cytometry showed they were positive for CD73 and CD105 while being negative for CD14, CD19, and HLA-DR. They were also able to differentiate into adipocytes, osteoblasts, and chondrocytes. HE and IF showed that MSCs formed 3D model structures on the polystyrene scaffold. MSC-CM collected from both 2DCC and 3DCC contained growth factors, e.g., platelet derived growth factor (PDGF-AB), transforming growth factor-1 (TGF-1), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1), interleukin 1 (IL-1), and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Concentrations of biomolecules secreted by MSCs in 3DCC were significantly higher than in 2DCC. CONCLUSION: It could be concluded that 3DCC of MSCs using a polystyrene scaffold is a novel approach to generate MSC secretome for therapeutic applications.",3D cell culture; 3D culture scaffold; Conditioned media; MSC secretome; Mesenchymal stem cells,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2022,,,,Biotechnol.

This study developed and then demonstrated the daily maintenance-free culture system equipped with both electrical stimulation and medium replacement functions. To avoid ethical issues, immortal myoblast cells C2C12 were used. The system consisting of gel culture molds, a medium replacement unit, and an electrical stimulation unit could produce 12 TEMs at one time. The contractile forces of the TEMs were measured with a newly developed microforce measurement system. Even the TEMs cultured without electrical stimulation generated forces of almost 2 mN and were shortened by 10% in tetanic contractions. Regarding the contractile forces, electrical stimulation by a single pulse at 1 Hz was most effective, and the contractile forces in tetanus were over 2.5 mN. On the other hand, continuous pulses decreased the contractile forces of TEMs. HE-stained cross-sections showed that myoblast cells proliferated and fused into myotubes mainly in the peripheral regions, and fewer cells existed in the internal region. This must be due to insufficient supplies of oxygen and nutrients inside the TEMs. By increasing the supplies, one TEM might be able to generate a force up to around 10 mN. The tetanic forces of the TEMs produced by the system were strong enough to actuate microstructures like previously reported crawling robots. This daily maintenance-free culture system which could stably produce TEMs strong enough to be utilized for microrobots should contribute to the advancement of biohybrid devices.",,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2021,2021,,,Cyborg and Bionic Systems,Science Partner Journal,2021-04-08,,,,10.34133/2021/9820505,,,,,en,,,,,,,,,,,2022-04-27,2022-04-27

This change in dietary preferences requires an in-depth insight into consumers’ preferences towards a variety of alternative/non-meat proteins. This study aimed to investigate the consumers’ preferences and willingness to purchase three alternative dietary protein sources, namely plant-, cultured meat- and insect-based proteins in four countries with dissimilar economic development status (the United Kingdom, Spain, Brazil and the Dominican Republic). It also aimed to determine which factors would most influence the willingness to purchase. From a total sample of 729 valid respondents, psychographic variables were analysed. The alternative protein deemed the respondents’ most preferred willing to purchase was the plant-based type since that option tended to be more widely available in the market. Among the analysed economic groups, the countries classified in the higher economic groups tended to show more readiness to replace traditional meats for the three alternatives. Models suggest that the respondents regarded the alternative characteristics and/or the attributes compared to meat as being the most important factors that influence their willingness to purchase rather than environmental, convenience or healthy buying decisions, or a low level of neophobia. If the perception of healthiness, safety and nutritiousness increases one-unit for the cultured meat in Brazil, the probability of willingness to purchase would increase 86.82%.

Engineered tissues often incorporate these interactions by employing cell-adhesive materials. However, using constitutively active cell-adhesive materials impedes control over cell fate and elicits inflammatory responses upon implantation. Here, an alternative cell-material interaction strategy that provides mechanotransducive properties via discrete inducible on-cell crosslinking (DOCKING) of materials, including those that are inherently non-cell-adhesive, is introduced. Specifically, tyramine-functionalized materials are tethered to tyrosines that are naturally present in extracellular protein domains via enzyme-mediated oxidative crosslinking. Temporal control over the stiffness of on-cell tethered 3D microniches reveals that DOCKING uniquely enables lineage programming of stem cells by targeting adhesome-related mechanotransduction pathways acting independently of cell volume changes and spreading. In short, DOCKING represents a bioinspired and cytocompatible cell-tethering strategy that offers new routes to study and engineer cell-material interactions, thereby advancing applications ranging from drug delivery, to cell-based therapy, and cultured meat.",adhesomes; biomechanics; cell volume; inflammation; lineage commitment; single-cell analysis; stem cell microniches,"Cultivated Meat Library,Deep dive: Cultivated meat scaffolding part A",,,,,,2021,33,42,e2102660,Adv.

The construction of structured CCM requires a three-dimensional (3D) scaffold to mimic the extracellular matrix to provide mechanical support for the cells. Furthermore, the 3D scaffolds should be edible and have good biocompatibility and tissue-like texture. Here, we demonstrated a 3D edible chitosan‑sodium alginate-collagen/gelatin (CS-SA-Col/Gel) scaffold that can support the adhesion and proliferation of porcine skeletal muscle satellite cells, culminating in the construction of a structured CCM model. The 3D edible scaffolds were prepared by freeze-drying using electrostatic interactions between chitosan and sodium alginate. Initially, the physicochemical properties and structural characteristics of different scaffolds were explored, and the biocompatibility of the scaffolds was evaluated using the C2C12 cell model. The results showed that the 2-CS-SA-Col1-Gel scaffold provided stable mechanical support and abundant adhesion sites for the cells. Subsequently, we inoculated porcine skeletal muscle satellite cells on the 2-CS-SA-Col1-Gel scaffold and induced differentiation for a total of 14 days. Immunofluorescence staining results showed cytoskeleton formation, and Western blotting (WB) and qPCR results showed upregulation of skeletal proteins and myogenic genes. Ultimately, the structured CCM model has similar textural properties (chewiness, springiness and resilience) and appearance to those of fresh pork.

Scope and approach Currently, 3D printing is being applied in food areas such as military and space food, elderly food, sweets food. An accurate and precise printing is critical to a successful and smooth printing. In this paper, we collect and analyze the information on how to achieve a precise and accurate food printing, and review the application of 3D printing in several food areas, as well as give some proposals and provide a critical insight into the trends and challenges to 3D food printing. Key findings and conclusions To realize an accurate and precise printing, three main aspects should be investigated considerably: material properties, process parameters, and post-processing methods. We emphasize that the factors below should be given special attention to achieve a successful printing: rheological properties, binding mechanisms, thermodynamic properties, pre-treatment and post-processing methods. In addition, there are three challenges on 3D food printing: 1) printing precision and accuracy 2) process productivity and 3) production of colorful, multi-flavor, multi-structure products.

Its use makes it possible to obtain products without planning and implementing a complex and costly manufacturing process. This makes 3DFP a technology of choice for the preparation of food products that meet specific needs, such as controlled nutritional or rheological properties. However, further technological developments are still needed before 3DFP can be considered fully useful for innovative and demanding applications. If both preparation and post-processing of materials based on 3D printing are optimized, aiming to reduce production time and/or complication for non-expert users, this would open a whole new range of possibilities. It is in this sense that the development of advanced 3DFP systems becomes a must. This chapter reviews current advances in extrusion-based 3D food printing systems, with in situ gelation and mixing as key aspects to better exploit the potential of 3DFP. On one hand, 3DFP systems based on in situ gelation (G3DFP) provide greater control over the final properties of the printed products, as the selection of adequate printing parameters gives the possibility of influencing the gelation process. On the other hand, mixing is indispensable for true 3DFP automation, so that the formulations do not have to be prepared by the user. Different innovative 3DFP systems based on gelling and/or mixing are presented in this chapter. Finally, the status and future of extrusion-based 3DFP, and its application in the production of customized foods for specific needs, are also overviewed.",3D food printing; Extrusion; Gelation; Hydrogels; Oleogels; Mixing; Dysphagia,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2022,,,,,Academic Press,2022-02-10,,,,10.1016/bs.afnr.2021.12.003,,,,,,,,,Advances in Food and Nutrition Research,,,,,,,2022-04-27,2022-04-27

However, while this product is still in development and not yet widely commercialised, it is already attracting various forms of criticism from consumers. The present study follows a large international online survey of 5,418 consumers in France which was aimed at understanding consumer perceptions of muscle cell culture for food purposes. Based on 118 interviews conducted on volunteers with specific dietary habits (vegans, vegetarians, flexitarians, regular meat consumers), the aim of this study was to target an audience with a variety of diets and thus to analyse more closely consumers' feelings towards this product. Regular meat consumers are more favourable to this product than vegetarians and vegans whose convictions prevent them from tasting artificial ""meat"". The consumption of this new product would be perceived by the latter as a step backwards. Of the 118 people questioned, half of them think that this product could have a negative impact on the animal industry, 41% fear undesirable health effects and 29% do not believe in the quality of this product. However, this new product arouses curiosity among the respondents, the majority of whom (80%) would like to try it. While the selling price of this product is questionable, 22% of respondents indicated that they had no intention of buying it. For those who were likely to buy this product, prices were expected to be lower or equal to those of conventional meat for 72% of them. Despite the uncertainties regarding its future development, the majority of respondents were optimistic about the future of this product. 80% of them believe it will become widespread more or less quickly, whether they like it or not, mainly because French people's mentalities are changing, despite that fact that the implementation of this product would appear difficult on certain points. The vegans are more likely to be neutral than the other consumers. There is no consensus on the term ""meat"" for this new foodstuff, with 25% of those questioned agreeing with the term ""cultured meat""(14%) in particular. The majority of flexitarians (55%) are opposed to the use of the term ""meat"" for this new product, whereas this term seems to be suitable for 91% of the vegans and 82% of the vegetarians.

Transgene-free methods of deriving myogenic progenitors from different PSC lines often produce mixed populations that are heterogeneous in myogenic differentiation potential, yet detailed and accurate characterization of human PSC-derived myogenic progenitors remains elusive in the field. The isolation and purification of human PSC-derived myogenic progenitors is thus an important methodological consideration when we investigate the properties and behaviors of these cells in culture. We previously reported a transgene-free, serum-free floating sphere culture method for the derivation of myogenic progenitors from human PSCs. In this study, we first performed comprehensive cell surface protein profiling of the sphere culture cells through the screening of 255 antibodies. Next, we used magnetic activated cell sorting and enriched the cells according to the expression of specific surface markers. The ability of muscle differentiation in the resulting cells was characterized by immunofluorescent labeling and quantification of positively stained cells. Our results revealed that myotube-forming cells resided in the differentiated cultures of CD29+, CD56+, CD271+, and CD15- fractions, while thick and multinucleated myotubes were identified in the differentiated cultures from CD9+ and CD146+ fractions. We found that PAX7 localization to the nucleus correlates with myotube-forming ability in these sorted populations. We also demonstrated that cells in unsorted, CD271+, and CD15- fractions responded differently to cryopreservation and prolonged culture expansion. Lastly, we showed that CD271 expression is essential for terminal differentiation of human PSC-derived myogenic progenitors. Taken together, these cell surface proteins are not only useful markers to identify unique cellular populations in human PSC-derived myogenic progenitors but also functionally important molecules that can provide valuable insight into human myogenesis.",,"Cultivated Meat Library,GFI-funded Research",,,,,,2022,2022,,2735414,Stem Cells Int.,,2022-02-24,,1687-966X,,10.1155/2022/2735414,35251185,PMC8894063,,"Department of Comparative Biosciences, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Wisconsin, USA.

In the current work, however, we suggest a different concept in which edible MCs can be incorporated into the final product, thus avoiding costly harvesting steps, and contributing to its nutritional values, textures, and appearance. Through addressing the different technological and biological aspects, we present the development of edible hydrogel MCs from chitosan and collagen, edible materials with a wide range of applications in tissue engineering. The obtained composite MCs have a uniform spherical shape of 571 μm diameter, a smooth surface, and suitable mechanical properties. These MCs support the attachment and rapid proliferation of mouse skeletal C2C12 myoblasts, rabbit smooth muscle cells, sheep fibroblasts, and bovine umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells, achieving complete coverage of the carrier surface within only a few days in culture.

However, because many drugs useful in this arena are biologic in nature, a paucity of delivery strategies for biologics, including growth factors, currently limits the control that can be exerted on the implantation environment. Layer-by-Layer (LbL) polyelectrolyte multilayer films are highly attractive as ultrathin biologic reservoirs, due to the capability to conformally coat difficult geometries, the use of aqueous processing likely to preserve fragile protein function, and the tunability of incorporation and release profiles. Herein, we describe the first LbL films capable of microgram-scale release of the biologic Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2 (BMP-2), which is capable of directing the host tissue response to create bone from native progenitor cells. Ten micrograms of BMP-2 are released over a period of two weeks in vitro; less than 1% is released in the first 3 h (compared with commercial collagen matrices which can release up to 60% of BMP-2, too quickly to induce differentiation). BMP-2 released from LbL films retains its ability to induce bone differentiation in MC3T3 E1S4 pre-osteoblasts, as measured by induction of alkaline phosphatase and stains for calcium (via Alizarin Red) and calcium matrix (via Von Kossa). In vivo, BMP-2 film coated scaffolds were compared with film coated scaffolds lacking BMP-2. BMP-2 coatings implanted intramuscularly were able to initiate host progenitor cells to differentiate into bone, which matured and expanded from four to 9 weeks as measured by MicroCT and histology. Such LbL films represent new steps towards controlling and tuning host response to implanted medical devices, which may ultimately increase the success of implanted devices, provide alternative new approaches toward bone wound healing, and lay the foundation for development of a multi-therapeutic release coating.",,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2011,32,5,1446-1453,Biomaterials,,2011-02,,0142-9612,1878-5905,10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.10.052,21084117,PMC3033887,,"Harvard MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA.",en,,,,,,,,,,,2022-04-27,2022-04-27

However, their translation into clinical applications is limited due to their short effective half-life, low stability, and rapid inactivation by enzymes under physiological conditions. To maximize the effectiveness of GFs and their biologically relevant applicability, a wide variety of sophisticated bio-inspired systems have been developed that augment tissue repair and cellular regeneration by controlling how much, when, and where GFs are released. Recently, protein immobilization techniques combined with nanomaterial carriers have shown promise in mimicking the natural healing cascade during tissue regeneration by augmenting the delivery and effectiveness of GFs. This review evaluates the latest techniques in direct immobilization and relevant biomaterials used for GF loading and release, including synthetic polymers, albumin, polysaccharides, lipids, mesoporous silica-based nanoparticles (NPs), and polymeric capsules. Specifically, we focus on GF-encapsulated NPs in functionalized microporous scaffolds as a promising alternative with the ability to mimic extracellular matrix (ECM) hierarchical architectures and components with high cell affinity and bioactivity. Finally, we discuss how these next-generation, advanced delivery systems have been used to enhance tissue repair and regeneration and consider future implications for their use in the field of regenerative medicine. Nanomaterials can speed up the rate at which wounds heal and tissue regenerates. Songlin Peng from the Jinan University Second College of Medicine, China, and colleagues review the development of artificial materials that achieve this aim by mimicking the hierarchical architecture of the extracellular matrix. Cells can proliferate and migrate by secreting proteins that signal to adjacent cells. These proteins – known as growth factors – bind to specific receptors on the target cell. But it is difficult to harness this simple concept in clinical applications such as wound healing because the instability of growth factors limits their safety and cost effectiveness. Peng and co-workers review recent progress in the use of functionalized microporous scaffolds functionalized with growth factor encapsulated nanoparticles. They also outline its advantages over alternative approaches employing polymers, lipids and mesoporous silica-based nanoparticles.

To recreate electrophysiology of muscle tissues, electroactive biomaterials have been used to stimulate muscle cells with exogenous electrical fields. In particular, the use of electroactive biomaterials with an anisotropic micro-/nanostructure that closely mimic the native skeletal-muscle extracellular matrix (ECM) is desirable for skeletal muscle tissue engineering. Herein, we present a hierarchically organized, anisotropic, and conductive Polycaprolactone/gold (PCL/Au) scaffold for guiding myoblasts alignment and promoting the elongation and maturation of myotubes under electrical stimulation. Culturing with H9c2 myoblasts cells indicated that the nanotopographic cues was crucial for nuclei alignment, while the presence of microscale grooves effectively enhanced both the formation and elongation of myotubes. The anisotropic structure also leads to anisotropic conductivity. Under electrical stimulation, the elongation and maturation of myotubes were significantly enhanced along the anisotropic scaffold. Specifically, compared to the unstimulated group (0 V), the myotube area percentage increased by 1.4, 1.9 and 2.4 times in the 1 V, 2 V, 3 V groups, respectively. In addition, the myotube average length in the 1 V group increased by 1.3 times compared to that of the unstimulated group, and significantly increased by 1.8 and 2.0 times in the 2 V, 3 V groups, respectively. Impressively, the longest myotubes reached more than 4 mm in both 2 V and 3 V groups.

Mold-based protein enriched scaffolds exhibited elevated stability and stiffness compared to ones made of Alginate(RGD) alone, while allowing unhindered BSC spreading and maturation. Extrusion based 3D-printing with the two compositions was then developed, while using an edible, removable agar support bath. Successfully fabricated constructs with well-defined geometries supported BSC attachment and differentiation. Finally, cellular bioprinting was demonstrated with PPI-enriched bioinks.

Stem cells require contact with extracellular matrices as well as signals from growth factors to proliferate and to retain their stemness. We have shown a novel tissue culture platform (StemTrix cultureware) that transforms standard tissue culture plasticware into a multi-functional chitosan-based scaffold that supports the expansion of neural stem cells. The StemTrix scaffold is comprised of chitosan with immobilized heparin which in turn tethers heparin-binding growth factors. The scaffold is also coated with an adhesive ECM protein. Here we demonstrate that fibronectin or the RGD peptide contained in fibronectin are equally effective in promoting the adhesion, viability and growth of rat and human neural stem cells. When FGF-2 and heparin-binding EGF are tethered to the StemTrix cultureware neural stem cells grow ∼3 times faster and remain in a more primitive state as determined by both Western Blot and gene expression analyses. Another important feature of this new culture platform is that the NSCs remain in a primitive and proliferative state for 4days without refreshing the culture medium or providing new growth factors, which represents a 20-fold extension of FGF-2's biological activity vs when it is freely soluble in the medium. To test the utility of this scaffold for propagating other types of stem cells and progenitors we tethered platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and FGF-2 alone and in combination to the scaffold and tested the efficacy of this platform to maintain primary oligodendrocyte progenitors or the CG-4 cell line in a primitive state. Oligodendrocyte progenitors plated onto this multifunctional film proliferated for at least 3days without providing soluble growth factors while inhibiting the expression of the differentiation marker myelin-basic protein. Oligodendrocyte progenitors proliferated 3 times more rapidly than cells maintained on fibronectin-coated culture substrates in culture medium supplemented with soluble FGF-2 and PDGF.

Polarization-modulated infrared reflectance-absorbance spectroscopic analysis demonstrated formation of well-ordered, close-packed self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), chemoselective conjugation of amine-terminated peptides to surface carboxylate groups, and subsequent conjugation of acetylene-terminated peptides to the azide groups on SAMs. Varying the mole fraction of HS-EG6-N3, HS-EG6-COOH, and HS-EG3 during SAM formation allowed for control over the densities of each peptide on the substrate. Substrates presenting varying surface densities of RGESP (a nonfunctional peptide), RGDSP (a cell adhesion peptide), or TYRSRKY (a heparin/heparan sulfate-binding peptide) were then used to characterize the relationship between peptide surface density and human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) adhesion. Results demonstrate that RGESP does not influence RGDSP-mediated adhesion of hMSCs, which indicates that a second peptide with distinct bioactivity can be immobilized alongside RGDSP to characterize the influence of two peptides on hMSC behavior. Our results also demonstrate that RGDSP and TYRSRKY act synergistically to promote hMSC adhesion in the absence of serum. Interestingly, heparin sequestered by TYRSRKY inhibits cell adhesion on substrates presenting RGDSP = 0.1% and > or = 0.1% TYRSRKY or RGDSP = 1% and > or = 0.5% TYRSRKY. Taken together, these results indicate that two peptides can be controllably presented to stem cells on the same otherwise bioinert SAM substrate, and that multiple, distinct extracellular moieties act in concert to regulate hMSC adhesion.",,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2010,26,9,6449-6456,Langmuir,,2010-05-04,,0743-7463,1520-5827,10.1021/la1008208,20353153,PMC2860651,,"Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin 53706, USA.",en,,,,,,,,,,,2022-04-27,2022-04-27

The tethered viral particles were stably maintained within scaffolds and SEM images illustrated that viral particles were evenly distributed in three-dimensional (3D) gelatin sponges. An in vivo study demonstrated that transgene expression was restricted to the implant sites only and transduction efficiency was improved using this conjugation method.

We here hypothesize that immobilizing a gradient of a growth/survival factor from the periphery to the center of a porous scaffold would guide endothelial cells into the interior of the scaffold, thus overcoming a necrotic core. Proteins were immobilized by one of three methods on porous collagen scaffolds for cardiovascular tissue engineering. The proteins were first activated with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide/sulfo N-hydroxysuccinimide and then applied to the scaffold by one of three methods to establish the gradient: perfusion (the flow method), use of a source and a sink (the source-sink method) or by injecting 5 μl of the solution at the center of the scaffold (point source method). Due to the high reproducibility and ease of application of the point source method it was further used for VEGF-165 gradient formation, where an ~2 ng ml(-1) mm(-1) gradient was formed in a radial direction across a scaffold, 12 mm in diameter and 2.5mm thick. More endothelial cells were guided by the VEGF-165 gradient deep into the center of the scaffold compared with both uniformly immobilized VEGF-165 (with the same total VEGF concentration) and VEGF-free controls. All scaffolds (including the controls) yielded the same number of cells, but notably the VEGF-165 gradient scaffolds demonstrated a higher cell density in the centre. Thus we concluded that the VEGF-165 gradient promoted the migration, but not proliferation, of cells into the scaffold.

Low intensity laser irradiation (LILI) has been shown to have positive effects on cells including adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs). Growth factors such as retinoic acid and transforming growth factor (TGF-β1) play significant roles in the differentiation of cells. This study aimed at investigating the role of LILI and growth factors on differentiation of adipose derived stem cells cocultured with smooth muscle cells (SMCs). The study used isolated human adipose derived stem cells and smooth muscle commercial cells (SKUT-1). The cells were cocultured directly in the ratio 1 : 1 using the established methods with and without growth factors (retinoic acid and TGF-β1) and then exposed to LILI at a wavelength of 636 nm with 5 J/cm2 using a diode laser. The cellular proliferation and expression of the both cell type markers were assessed using optical density and flow cytometry at 24 h and 72 h. The study showed that LILI increased the proliferation of cocultured cells. The expression of the smooth muscle cell markers increased in the coculture groups that were exposed to LILI in the presence of growth factors while those of the ADSCs decreased.,,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2014,2014,,,Int.

One technological approach to cultured meat production utilises the proliferative and differentiative capacity of muscle-derived satellite cells (SCs) to produce large volumes of cultured muscle tissue from small biopsies of donor animals. Differing genotypes between cattle breeds lead to predictable phenotypic traits, resulting in breeds being favoured for their respective meat or milk production characteristics in the livestock industry. However, whilst these breeds show significant differences in muscle growth, it is unclear whether the physiological differences observed between them in vivo are reflected in differences in SC behaviour in vitro , particularly with respect to proliferation, differentiation and cellular longevity, and hence whether particular breeds might represent preferred SC donors for a cultured beef bioprocess. Results Comparing SCs isolated from five breeds (Belgian Blue, Holstein Friesian, Galloway, Limousin and Simmental), we found that the proliferation rates were largely unaffected by the donor breed. In contrast, potentially meaningful differences were observed in the kinetics and extent of myogenic differentiation. Furthermore, whilst differentiation dropped for all breeds with increasing population doublings (PDs), SCs from Belgian Blue and Limousin cattle showed significantly longer retention of differentiation capacity over long-term passaging. Conclusion SCs from all breeds were able to proliferate and differentiate, although Limousin and (particularly) Belgian Blue cattle, both breeds commonly used for traditional meat production, may represent preferred donors for cultured beef production. ### Competing Interest Statement LM, RH, TM and JEF are employees of Mosa Meat B.V.

Tissue engineering appeared as a promising therapeutic strategy capable of overcoming this unmet clinical need. To attain such goal, herein we propose an in situ-crosslinking gellan gum (GG)-based hydrogel tethered with a skeletal muscle-inspired laminin-derived peptide RKRLQVQLSIRTC(Q) and encapsulated with skeletal muscle cells (SMCs). Pre-hydrogel solutions presented decreasing shear viscosity with increasing shear rate and shear stress, and required low forces for extrusion, validating their injectability. The GGDVS hydrogel was functionalized with Q-peptide with 30% of efficiency. C2C12 were able to adhere to the developed hydrogel, remained living and spreading 7 days post-encapsulation. Q-peptide release studies indicated that 25% of the unbound peptide can be released from the hydrogels up to 7 days, dependent on the hydrogel formulation. Treatment of a chemically-induced muscular lesion in mice with an injection of C2C12-laden hydrogels improved myogenesis, primarily promoted by the C2C12. In accordance, a high density of myoblasts (α-SA+ and MYH7+) were localized in tissues treated with the C2C12 (alone or encapsulated in the hydrogel). α-SA protein levels were significantly increased 8 weeks post-treatment with C2C12-laden hydrogels and MHC protein levels were increased in all experimental groups 4 weeks post-treatment, in relation to the SHAM. Neovascularization and neoinnervation was also detected in the defects. Altogether, this study indicates that C2C12-laden hydrogels hold great potential for skeletal muscle regeneration. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: We developed an injectable gellan gum-based hydrogel for delivering C2C12 into localized myopathic model. The gellan gum was biofunctinalized with laminin-derived peptide to mimic the native muscular ECM. In addition, hydrogel was physically tuned to mimic the mechanical properties of native tissue. To the best of our knowledge, this formula was used for the first time under the context of skeletal muscle tissue regeneration. The injectability of the developed hydrogel provided non-invasive administration method, combined with a reliable microenvironment that can host C2C12 with nominal inflammation, indicated by the survival and adhesion of encapsulated cells post-injection.

Here, we report an effective isolation protocol to economically and conveniently retrieve active MSCs from skeletal muscle tissues in mice. Methods and Results: We optimized an enzyme-based tissue digestion protocol for isolating skeletal muscle-derived primary cell population having a large number of active MSCs and described a method of differential plating (DP) for improving purity of active MSCs from skeletal muscle-derived primary cell population. Then, the age of the mouse appropriate to the isolation of a large number of active MSCs was elucidated. The best isolation yield of active MSCs from mouse skeletal muscle tissues was induced by the application of DP method to the primary cell population harvested from skeletal muscle tissues of 2-week-old mice digested in 0.2% (w/v) collagenase type II for 30 min at 37℃ and then in 0.1% (w/v) pronase for 5 min at 37℃. Conclusions: The protocol we developed not only facilitates the isolation of MSCs but also maximizes the retrieval of active MSCs. Our expectation is that this protocol will contribute to the development of original technologies essential for muscle therapy and artificial meat industrialization in the future.",Differential plating; Enzymatic dissociation; High-yield isolation; Mouse; Muscle satellite cells,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2022,,,,Int J Stem Cells,,2022-02-28,,2005-3606,,10.15283/ijsc21179,35220284,,,"Department of Animal Life Science, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon, Korea.

First, it sets out to compare consumer acceptance of lab-grown meat in the U.S. and in Singapore. Second, it seeks to explain the difference in Americans' and Singaporeans' acceptance of lab-grown meat by examining their eating motivations. Specifically, we focused on social image motivations - the motivations to present oneself positively in social contexts. Third, this study also aims to assess if exposure to information about lab-grown meat communicated by celebrity versus expert social media influencers (SMIs) can impact people's acceptance of lab-grown meat products. Our analysis showed that Singaporean participants had greater acceptance of lab-grown meat compared to their American counterparts, and this cultural difference was explained by Singaporeans' stronger social image eating motivations. In other words, cross-country differences in motivation to eat for a favorable social image can explain differences in consumer acceptance of lab-grown meat. The Singaporean cultural trait of kiasuism, which is exemplified by the fear of losing out or being left behind, may explain Singaporeans' motivation to project an image of being 'trailblazers' (vis-a-vis other nationalities) by expressing a higher acceptance of novel foods such as lab-grown meat. Results also revealed that the information about lab-grown meat being communicated by a celebrity or an expert SMI did not make a difference in participants' acceptance of lab-grown meat in both countries. Together, this research suggests an interesting implication that novel food industries and marketers can promote product branding by boosting media coverage (including online social media) of their lab-grown products' 'firsts' (e.g., the first production line in the world, the first technological breakthrough), especially in markets with high social image concerns.",Alternative proteins; Lab-grown meat; Eating motivations; Social image; Social media influencers (SMIs),Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2022,173,,105990,Appetite,,2022-06-01,,0195-6663,1095-8304,10.1016/j.appet.2022.105990,35245644,,,"Singapore Management University, Lee Kong Chian School of Business, 50 Stamford Rd, Singapore, 178899.

The main TE principles include usage of cells, grown in a controlled environment provided by bioreactors and cultivation media supplemented with growth factors and other needed nutrients and signaling molecules, and seeded onto the immobilization elements-microcarriers and scaffolds that provide the adhesion surfaces necessary for anchor-dependent cells and offer 3D organization for multiple cell types. Theoretically, many solutions from regenerative medicine and biomedical engineering can be applied in CM-TE, i.e., CA. However, in practice, there are a number of specificities regarding fabrication of a CM product that needs to fulfill not only the majority of functional criteria of muscle and fat TE, but also has to possess the sensory and nutritional qualities of a traditional food component, i.e., the meat it aims to replace. This is the reason that bioengineering aimed at CM production needs to be regarded as a specific scientific discipline of a multidisciplinary nature, integrating principles from biomedical engineering as well as from food manufacturing, design and development, i.e., food engineering. An important requirement is also the need to use as little as possible of animal-derived components in the whole CM bioprocess. In this review, we aim to present the current knowledge on different bioengineering aspects, pertinent to different current scientific disciplines but all relevant for CM engineering, relevant for muscle TE, including different cell sources, bioreactor types, media requirements, bioprocess monitoring and kinetics and their modifications for use in CA, all in view of their potential for efficient CM bioprocess scale-up.

Multinomial logistic regressions were used to explain factors associated with consumers’ willingness to consume lab-grown meat products. Factors associated with willingness to consume the lab-grown meat products were positive beliefs regarding eating experience (enjoyment), safety, animal welfare, and healthiness; familiarity; higher consumption frequency of conventionally raised chicken meat; tertiary education; and younger age.

Nutrients (glucose, amino acids, and vitamins) present in the animal-cell culture media were effectively recovered from C. vulgaris using acid hydrolysis treatment. On culture in nutrient-free inorganic salt solution, cell death was induced in most PBMs after 6 days of cultivation. However, the addition of C. vulgaris extract (CVE) significantly improved PBM viability, which was comparable to the viability in conventional culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium). Furthermore, by adding horse serum to induce differentiation, the formation of myotubes was confirmed when CVE were used. Together, the results showed that CVE could be used as an alternative to the conventional culture medium for PBMs. These findings will not only lower the environmental risks associated with the establishment of this eco-friendly cell culture system, but also highlight microalgae as a potent nutrient source that can replace conventional grain-dependent nutrient sources.",Chlorella vulgaris; cultured meat; microalgal extract; myotube formation; nutrients; primary bovine myoblast,Cultivated Meat Library,Not CC-licensed,,,Bos taurus,,2022,,,e3239,Biotechnol.

One of the leading fields aimed at sustainable agriculture is in vitro meat production. Cellular agriculture aims to provide a source of animal-free meat products, which would decrease worldwide nutritional dependency on animal husbandry, thereby reducing the significant impact of this industry on Earth's climate. However, while some studies successfully produced lab-based meat on a small scale, scalability of this approach requires significant optimisation of the methodology in order to ensure its viability on an industrial scale. One of the methodological promises of in vitro meat production is the application of cell suspension-based bioreactors. Hence, this study focused on a complex transcriptomic comparison of adherent undifferentiated, differentiated and suspension-cultured myosatellite cells, aiming to determine the effects of different culture methods on their transcriptome. Modern next-generation sequencing (RNAseq) was used to determine the levels of transcripts in the cultures' cell samples. Then, differential expression and pathway analyses were performed using bionformatical methods. The significantly regulated pathways included: EIF2, mTOR, GP6, integrin and HIFα signalling. Differential regulation of gene expression, as well as significant enrichment and modulation of pathway activity, suggest that suspension culture potentially promotes the ex vivo-associated loss of physiological characteristics and gain of plasticity. Therefore, it seems that suspension cultures, often considered the desired method for in vitro meat production, require further investigation to fully elucidate their effect on myosatellite cells and, therefore, possibly enable their easier scalability to ensure suitability for industrial application.",differentiation; gene markers; satellite cell; signalling pathways,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,Meleagris gallopavo,,2022,13,2,,Genes ,,2022-01-27,,2073-4425,,10.3390/genes13020242,35205287,PMC8871586,,"Prestage Department of Poultry Sciences, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC 27695, USA.

Furthermore, cell morphology, viability, and myogenic differentiation were observed for 7 days of cultivation. Intriguingly, the metabolic difference is more dominant between the cell status than medium effects. In addition, proliferative myoblast showed more distinct metabolic differences than differentiated myotubes in different culture conditions. The intracellular levels of GL3P and UDP-GlcNAc were significantly increased in myotubes versus myoblast. Non-essential amino acids and pyruvate reduction and transamination showed significant differences among serum, B27, and AIM-V cultures.

BAM model outperforms others in terms of macro F1 score and accuracy and is employed on the whole dataset later. The sentiment analysis result shows that among 41782 related posts we accumulated, about 42.10% of posts are personal posts consisting of negative, neutral, and positive feelings towards AM with a proportion of 28.77%, 22.91%, and 48.32% respectively.

Our findings add to the blooming body of studies suggesting the relationship of people’s willingness to try or purchase AM and factors including gender, geography, price, veganism, and food safety. Conspiracy theory is identified for the first time as the main reason for opposition to AM among Chinese consumers.

In addition, fish cell lines are very useful in vitro models for toxicological, pathological, and immunological studies. The easier maintenance of fish cell lines in flexible temperature regimes and hypoxic conditions make them preferable in vitro tools over mammalian cell lines. Great excitement has been observed in establishing and characterizing new fish cell lines representing diverse fish species and tissue types. The well-characterized and authenticated cell lines are of utmost essential as these represent cellular functions very similar to in vivo state of an organism otherwise it would affect the reproducibility of scientific research. CONCLUSION: The fish cell lines have exhibited encouraging results in several key aspects of in vitro research in aquaculture including virology, nutrition and metabolism, production of vaccines, and transgenic fish production. The review paper reports the cell lines developed from fish, their characterization, and biobanking along with their potential applications and challenges in in vitro research.",Applications; Bio-banking; Cell-based aquaculture; Fish cell line; In vitro research,"Cultivated Meat Library,PISCES/ATLAS,Papers by GFI grantees",,,,,,2022,49,3,2393-2411,Mol.

This study aimed at investigating associations between the consumer groups and demographic and psychographic factors as well as identifying distinct consumer groups based on their current willingness to engage with cultured meat. Four European countries were studied: the Netherlands (NL), the United Kingdom (UK), France (FR) and Spain (ES). A sample of 1291 responses from all four countries was collected between February 2017 and March 2019. Cluster analysis was used, resulting in three groups in the NL and UK, and two groups in FR and ES. The results suggest that Dutch consumers are the most willing to engage with cultured meat.

Age, environmental and ethical issues, and scepticism about new food technologies are the most important factors that guide consumer acceptance of cultured meat.

Though future visions for such a shift have often centred on how much land could be saved through the deployment of new biotechnologies, proponents and researchers today increasingly also foreground the future economic geographies and sites of production that these should engender. In this paper I explore such envisioned geographies, building on 24 interviews with cellular-agricultural actors and on observations during meetings. Essentially echoing an ecomodernist embrace of the Anthropocene as a great opportunity, cellular-agriculturalists frequently promise that the technologies they advocate should offer the possibility to unfetter the production of animal products from spatial constraints. (Post-)animal products can now be produced anywhere. But in assuring that products and production processes should feel familiar, they frequently also describe a world where microbrewery-like facilities and transparent production processes supplant industrialised animal agriculture's remote slaughterhouses. Hence, a kind of craft-emphasising ?recombinant? ecomodernism emerges. In exploring cellular-agricultural future visions, my aim is not to determine whether, or which, particular visions might be realised. Rather, I centre on descriptions of future spaces of production and economic geographies in order to explore contemporary biotech boosterism. Engaging with these visions, as well as the often unchronicled creative destruction that they could entail, thus allows me to contribute to an emerging set of texts that scrutinise the current and intended political economy (and ecology) of cellular agriculture, as well as texts emphasising the necessity of pondering Anthropocene spatialities.",,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2020,45,4,921-936,Trans.

The present work now sets to explore the potential application of continuous bioprocess methods to source large numbers of human adherent cells with potential therapeutic value. To this purpose, we developed a smart multifunctional surface coating capable of controlling the attachment, proliferation, and subsequent self-detachment of human corneal stromal cells. This system allowed the maintenance of cell cultures under steady-state growth conditions, where self-detaching cells were continuously replenished by the proliferation of those remaining attached. This facilitated a closed, continuous bioprocessing platform with recovery of approximately 1% of the total adherent cells per hour, a yield rate that was maintained for 1 month. Moreover, both attached and self-detached cells were shown to retain their original phenotype. Together, these results represent the proof-of-concept for a new high-throughput, high-standard, and low-cost biomanufacturing strategy with multiple potentials and important downstream applications.",cell self-release; continuous bioprocessing; corneal stromal cells; peptide amphiphiles; retinoic acid; smart materials,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2017,9,47,41131-41142,ACS Appl.

Participants responded to a range of measures including adoption indicators, estimated yearly intake, motivators for purchasing, desired product characteristics, preferred species, and sociodemographics. We found a high degree of openness to both products. For plant-based meat, 67% were highly likely to try and 59% were highly likely to purchase. For cultivated meat, 60% were highly likely to try and 53% were highly likely to purchase. The highest acceptance was amongst the younger generations: 60% of born-frees, 62% of millennials, and 53% of Gen X were highly likely to purchase plant-based meat and 55% of born-frees, 55% of millennials, and 46% of Gen X were highly likely to purchase cultivated meat. For the general population, we observed that future meat intake was estimated to be split equally among the three meat categories (conventional, cultivated, and plant-based). We found early adopters (those highly likely to purchase) to be quite similar in attitudinal and sociodemographic characteristics in comparison to the general population.

Here, we employ MyoD-induced transdifferentiation of fibroblasts as a model to illustrate the chromatin structures that impede the cell-fate transition. Focusing on the three-dimensional (3D) chromatin interactions, we show that MyoD directly establishes chromatin loops to activate myogenic transcriptional program. Similarly, dynamic changes of CTCF-mediated chromatin interactions are favorable for fibroblast-to-myoblast conversion. However, a substantial portion of CTCF-mediated chromatin interactions remain stable, and the associated genes are steady in expression and enriched for fibroblast function that may restrict cell-identity transformation. Temporal CTCF depletion can interrupt the resistant chromatin loops to enhance myogenic transdifferentiation in mice, pig, and chicken fibroblasts. Therefore, during induced transdifferentiation, the transcription factor can directly reorganize the 3D chromatin interactions, and perturbation of CTCF-mediated genome topology may resolve the limitations of cell fate transitions.",CP: Molecular biology; CP: Stem cell research; CTCF; HiChIP; MyoD; chromatin interaction; fibroblast; myogenic; scRNA-seq; transdifferentiation,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,"Sus scrofa,Gallus gallus",,2022,40,7,111206,Cell Rep.,,2022-08-16,,2211-1247,,10.1016/j.celrep.2022.111206,35977522,,,"Key Laboratory of Agricultural Animal Genetics, Breeding, and Reproduction of the Ministry of Education, College of Animal Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China; College of Animal Science and Technology, Shandong Agricultural University, Taian, China.

However, there are few studies on how the composition of FBS differs from blood or serum composition in adult animals, which is probably one of the main reasons for not successfully replacing FBS. Moreover, recent studies on the development of FBS replacers and serum-free media have shown that it is difficult to conclude whether FBS has been completely replaced or serum-free media have been developed successfully.

Cultured meat is an example of a cellular agriculture product, made by using tissue engineering methods. This study aims to improve the understanding of the potential environmental impacts of cultured meat production by comparing between different bioprocess design scenarios. This was done by carrying out a life cycle assessment (LCA) for a bioprocess system using hollow fiber bioreactors, and utilizing bench-scale experimental data for C2C12 cell proliferation, differentiation and media metabolism. Scenario and sensitivity analyses were used to test the impact of changes in the system design, data sources, and LCA methods on the results to support process design decision making. We compared alternative scenarios to a baseline of C2C12 cells cultured in hollow fiber bioreactors using media consisting of DMEM with serum, for a 16-day proliferation stage and 7-day differentiation stage. The baseline LCA used the average UK electricity mix as the energy source, and heat treatment for wastewater sterilization. The greatest reduction in environmental impacts were achieved with the scenarios using CHO cells instead of C2C12 cells (64-67 % reduction); achieving 128 % cell biomass increase during differentiation instead of no increase (42-56 % reduction); using wind electricity instead of average UK electricity (6-39 % reduction); and adjusting the amino acid use based on experimental data (16-27 % reduction). The use of chemical wastewater treatment instead of heat treatment increased all environmental impacts, except energy demand, by 1-16 %.

Furthermore, insect fat cells have long been cultured and characterized for basic biology and recombinant protein production but not for food production. To develop a food-relevant approach to insect fat cell cultivation and tissue engineering, Manduca sexta cells were cultured and induced to accumulate lipids in 2D and 3D formats within decellularized mycelium scaffolding. The resultant in vitro fat tissues were characterized and compared to in vivo fat tissue data by imaging, lipidomics, and texture analyses. The cells exhibited robust lipid accumulation when treated with a 0.1 mM soybean oil emulsion and had ""healthier"" fat profiles, as measured by the ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids.

The objective of the study was to determine what it will cost to produce cell-cultured meat in a large-scale ($60 million) production facility that produces 540,000 kg of product annually. Many of the funders behind this industry hope to reduce the environmental and land impacts of our current agricultural system. Although the initial goal is to use stem cells that must be replenished directly from animals, many firms want to develop cell lines that allow them to be independent of animals in the future. The technologies used to produce cell-cultured meat are continuously being improved, so there is still much uncertainty on what the final product will cost. Previous research has focused primarily on the cost of the cell-culture medium—a liquid or gel designed to support the growth of cells—rather than other potentially important costs. We estimate startup, production, employment, and transportation costs in addition to available cell-culture medium costs and expected output per batch to create a full-detailed enterprise budget. Cost estimates are calculated using (1) cell-cultured bioprocess information from published literature; (2) bioreactor and cold storage infrastructure information from engineers; and (3) prices and quantities of other relevant costs obtained from public and private sources. Results suggest that the cell-cultured meat industry has a long way to go before it can operate and make an acceptable return on investment. Assuming that technology will be developed to reduce the cost of the medium including growth hormone substitutes and buying ingredients in bulk, 1 kg of cell-cultured meat is estimated to cost $63/kg to produce in a large-scale facility. The three major costs of production are the cell-culture medium, bioreactors, and labor. These costs make up over 80% of the overall cost of production.",Cell-cultured meat; Cellular agriculture; Food economics; Livestock GHG emissions; Meat substitute,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2022,10,,100358,Journal of Agriculture and Food Research,,2022-12-01,,2666-1543,,10.1016/j.jafr.2022.100358,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-26,2022-08-31

However, fish cell culture is relatively understudied in comparison to mammalian cells. Here, we established and characterized a continuous Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus) skeletal muscle cell line (Mack cells). The cells were isolated from muscle biopsies of fresh-caught fish, with separate isolations performed from two distinct fish. Mack1 cells (cells from the first isolation) were cultured for over a year and subcultured over 130 times. The cells proliferated at initial doubling times of 63.9 hr (+/- 19.1 SD). After a spontaneous immortalization crisis from passages 37-43, the cells proliferated at doubling times of 24.3 hr (+/- 4.91 SD). A muscle phenotype was confirmed through characterization of muscle stemness and differentiation via paired-box protein 7 (PAX7) and myosin heavy chain (MHC) immunostaining, respectively. An adipocyte-like phenotype was also demonstrated for the cells through lipid accumulation, confirmed via Oil Red O (ORO) staining and quantification of neutral lipids. New qPCR primers (HPRT, PAX3B, MYOD1, MYOG, TNNT3A, and PPARG) were tailored to the mackerel genome and used to characterize mackerel cell genotypes.

Here, the bioactive electrospun nanofibers were evaluated through morphological, mechanical and biological characterizations. The results revealed that the scaffolds were porous with no specific alignment and average fiber diameter of 420±212 nm. Molecular analyzes revealed that in contrast to cellulose acetate scaffold, annatto-loaded cellulose acetate scaffold favor a proliferative state of C2C12 mouse skeletal myoblasts. SEM microscopy images suggests that the nanofiber substrates can sustain long-term culture of the cells, up to 28 days.

We optimized the fish gelatin/agar matrix's microstructure by controlling the ratio of the two biopolymers, stably introducing a cell adhesive environment on the TVP. By coating the optimized gelatin/agar matrix on the TVP's surface using an easy and fast dipping method, hybrid cultured meat composed of animal cells and plant protein was produced.

One option for reducing the sector’s climate footprint is the development and introduction of new forms of plant-based and lab-grown meat alternatives that accurately replicate the sensory and nutritional qualities of meat. Since the current global trend is toward increased meat consumption, these products are designed to appeal primarily to meat-eaters (not vegetarians or vegans) with the intention of enticing them to reduce or eliminate their consumption of animal meat. While this technology promises the undeniable benefits of reducing GHG and animal suffering, I argue that its widespread adoption could exacerbate global inequity, particularly between affluent and poor individuals and nations. To make my case, I identify four potential sources of inequity: the creation of luxury foods, an expansion of food deserts, increased economic disparity between the Global North and South, and the awarding of patents on the technology to multinational corporations. In light of economic pressures and dietary trends, it is likely these new meat alternatives will be introduced into the global market.

However, the harvest and collection procedures of FBS raise ethical concerns and serum is an ill-defined and expensive component. This is especially problematic when it comes to regulatory approval for food applications like cultured meat. The aim of this study is to develop a chemically defined, cost efficient serum-free and animal-free medium that supports the attachment and expansion of bovine myoblasts while maintaining their differentiation capacity. Bovine satellite cells were harvested and isolated from a fresh sample of skeletal muscle tissue and cultured in planar systems. The efficacy of the tested formulations was assessed with metabolic assays and cell counting techniques. Optical microscopy was used to observe cellular morphology and statistical analysis was applied. Based on a comprehensive literature analysis, a defined serum-free medium (SFM) composition was developed consisting of DMEM/F12 as basal medium, supplemented with L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate, fibronectin, hydrocortisone, GlutaMAX™, albumin, ITS-X, hIL-6, α-linolenic acid, and growth factors such as FGF-2, VEGF, IGF-1, HGF, and PDGF-BB. To our knowledge, this is the first defined serum-free and animal free medium formulation specific for bovine myoblasts to date. We conclude that the SFM formulation supported exponential cell growth up to 97% of the serum-containing golden standard growth medium.

While dietary protein plays a key role in the prevention of PEM, it also plays a pivotal role in the environmental impact of the human diet. In search for sustainable dietary strategies to increase protein intake in older adults, this study investigated the readiness of older adults to accept the consumption of the following alternative, more sustainable protein sources: plant-based protein, insects, single-cell protein, and in vitro meat. Using ordinal logistic regression modeling, the associations of different food-related attitudes and behavior and sociodemographics with older adults' acceptance to consume such protein sources were assessed. Results were obtained through a consumer survey among 1825 community-dwelling older adults aged 65 years or above in five EU countries (United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, and Finland). Dairy-based protein was generally the most accepted protein source in food products (75% of the respondents found its consumption acceptable or very acceptable). Plant-based protein was the most accepted alternative, more sustainable protein source (58%) followed by single-cell protein (20%), insect-based protein (9%), and in vitro meat-based protein (6%). We found that food fussiness is a barrier to acceptance, whereas green eating behavior and higher educational attainment are facilitators to older adults' acceptance to eat protein from alternative, more sustainable sources. Health, sensory appeal, and price as food choice motives, as well as gender and country of residence were found to influence acceptance, although not consistently across all the protein sources. Findings suggest that there is a window of opportunity to increase older adults' acceptance of alternative, more sustainable protein sources and in turn increase protein intake in an environmentally sustainable way in EU older adults.",community-dwelling older adults; consumer; dietary protein; protein-energy malnutrition (PEM); sustainability,"Cultivated Meat Library,Deep dive: Cultivated meat end products",,,,,,2019,11,8,,Nutrients,,2019-08-15,,2072-6643,,10.3390/nu11081904,31443177,PMC6723411,,"Department of Health Sciences, Faculty of Science, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam Public Health Research Institute, De Boelelaan 1085, 1081 HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

In terms of negative attitudes and intentions toward cultured meat, the most powerful predictors were food neophobia, political conservatism, and distrust of food scientists. When it comes to absolute opposition to cultured meat - defined by the unconditional belief that it should never be allowed under any circumstances - the strongest predictors were food and hygiene disgust sensitivity subscales, food neophobia, and conspiratorial ideation. A number of presumed mechanisms held no relationships to cultured meat attitudes, including social dominance orientation, speciesism, and naturalness bias.

During these reactions a sensory degradation of the product occurs, causing consumer rejection. In addition, there is a nutritional loss that leads to the formation of toxic substances, so the control of oxidative processes is of vital importance for the meat industry. Nonetheless, despite lipid oxidation being widely investigated for decades, the complex reactions involved in the process, as well as the different pathways and factors that influenced them, make that lipid oxidation mechanisms have not yet been completely understood.

A more mature muscle construct may be needed especially for the potential applications for regenerative medicine purposes, disease or drug disposition models. Most efforts towards dynamic cell or tissue culture methods have been geared towards mechanical or electrical stimulation or a combination of those. In the context of dynamic methods, pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) stimulation has been extensively used in bone tissue engineering, but the impact of PEMF on skeletal muscle development is poorly explored. Here, we evaluated the effects of PEMF stimulation on human skeletal muscle cells both in 2D and 3D experiments. First, PEMF was applied on 2D cultures of human myoblasts during differentiation. In 2D, enhanced myogenesis was observed, as evidenced by an increased myotube diameter and fusion index. Second, 2D results were translated towards 3D bioartificial muscles (BAMs). BAMs were subjected to PEMF for varying exposure times, where a 2-h daily stimulation was found to be effective in enhancing 3D myotube formation. Third, applying this protocol for the entire 16-days culture period was compared to a stimulation starting at day 8, once the myotubes were formed. The latter was found to result in significantly higher myotube diameter, fusion index, and increased myosin heavy chain 1 expression.

Aroma compounds are challenging to extract, concentrate, separate, identify, and quantify due to the complexity of meat. A wide range of volatile compounds of different properties (molecular weight, polarity, vapor pressure) are present in raw meat at varying concentrations, and further exacerbated post cooking due to the creation of additional volatiles through mainly Maillard reactions and lipid oxidation reactions. The volatiles identified in cooked meats include hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, esters, lactones, ethers, heterocyclic constituents, and sulfur-/halogen-containing components. From published research, some of the key volatiles influencing cooked beef/pork flavor include hexanal, octanal, nonanal, 1-nonanal, (E,E)-2,4-decadienal, methional, 3-methyl-1-butanol, methanethiol, 2-furfurylthiol, 2-metyl-3-furanthiol, 3-mercapto-2-pentanone, 4-hydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3-(2H)-furanone, 1-penten-3-one, 2-pentyl-furan, N-morpholinomethyl-isopropyl=sulfide, and methyl butyrate. GC-MS is the method of choice for their separation and identification. The technical options available have never been greater to elucidate these key volatiles impacting sensory perception. This review presents a summary of the main extraction/concentration techniques, highlighting their potential pros and cons, how advances in two-dimensional gas chromatography may help elucidate more key aroma compounds, and outlines the benefits of olfactometry to determine the main odor-active volatiles in beef and pork.",,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,"Bos taurus,Sus scrofa",,2022,,,,Sep.

However, actually only a small number of odor-active activities, i.e., odorants, play roles in meat aroma. This review summarized in total 332 odorants identified in thermally cooked meat species (e.g., stewed pork) in the recent 40 years by GC-O through the search of relevant literatures. They included l57 compounds from the lipid degradation, 98 compounds from the Maillard reaction, 18 compounds from the interaction of the lipid degradation and the Maillard reaction (lipid-Maillard interaction), and 59 compounds from other sources, while the formation mechanisms are discussed based on the recent developments. Overall, the aliphatic aldehydes had the greatest number, followed by sulfur-containing compounds, nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds, oxygen-containing heterocyclic compounds, ketones, alcohols, etc. The frequently potent odorants in different cooked meat species are the short-chain aliphatic aldehydes of C6-C10 carbons and 1-oceten-3-ol (or 1-octen-3-one) and sulfur-containing or nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds. PLS-DA analysis suggested variation of odorants among the cooked beef, pork, poultry, and sheep was more due to the lipid degradation than the Maillard reaction, and marginally due to the lipid-Maillard interaction.

Microcarriers provide a strategy to culture sufficient volumes of adherent cells in a bioreactor that are required for meat products. However, cell culture on inedible microcarriers involves extra downstream processing to dissociate cells prior to consumption. Here, we present edible microcarriers that can support the expansion and differentiation of myogenic cells in a single bioreactor system. To fabricate edible microcarriers with a scalable process, we used water-in-oil emulsions as templates for gelatin microparticles. We also developed a novel embossing technique to imprint edible microcarriers with grooved topology in order to test if microcarriers with striated surface texture can promote myoblast proliferation and differentiation in suspension culture. In this proof-of-concept demonstration, we showed that edible microcarriers with both smooth and grooved surface topologies supported the proliferation and differentiation of mouse myogenic C2C12 cells in a suspension culture. The grooved edible microcarriers showed a modest increase in the proliferation and alignment of myogenic cells compared to cells cultured on smooth, spherical microcarriers. During the expansion phase, we also observed the formation of cell-microcarrier aggregates or ‘microtissues’ for cells cultured on both smooth and grooved microcarriers. Myogenic microtissues cultured with smooth and grooved microcarriers showed similar characteristics in terms of myotube length, myotube volume fraction, and expression of myogenic markers. To establish feasibility of edible microcarriers for cultured meat, we showed that edible microcarriers supported the production of myogenic microtissue from C2C12 or bovine satellite muscle cells, which we harvested by centrifugation into a cookable meat patty that maintained its shape and exhibited browning during cooking.

To address this problem, research on the development and production of cultured meat as an alternative meat source using muscle stem cells in vitro has recently been undertaken. Many studies have been conducted on myosatellite cells for medical purposes, but studies on alternative meat production are rare. In vitro cell culture mimics the in vivo environment for cell growth. The satellite cell niche is closer to hypoxic (2% O2) than normoxic (20% O2) conditions. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficient oxygen conditions of myosatellite cell cultures for the production of cultured meat. The bovine satellite cell counts and mRNA (Pax7, Myf5 and HIF1α) levels were higher in hypoxia than normoxia (p < 0.05). Through Hoechst-positive nuclei counts, and expression of Pax7, MyoD and myosin protein by immunofluorescence, it was confirmed that muscle cells performed normal proliferation and differentiation. Myoblast fusion was higher under hypoxic conditions (p < 0.05), and the myotube diameters were also thicker (p < 0.05). In the myotube, the number of cells was high in hypoxia, and the expression of the total protein amounts, differentiation marker mRNA (myogenin, myosin and TOM20), and protein markers (myosin and TOM20) was also high. The study results demonstrated that the proliferation and differentiation of bovine myosatellite cells were promoted more highly under hypoxic conditions than under normoxic conditions.

Cultured meat produced using cell culture technology promises to become a viable alternative to animal-raised meat for the future of the food industry. In this study, biomimetic bovine muscle tissue was artificially fabricated from myogenic cells extracted from bovine meat. Our primary culture method relies on three key factors; a sequential digesting process, enzymatic treatment with pronase, and coating with laminin fragment on culture dishes. This method allows the efficient collection of large numbers of primary cells from bovine cheek meat, purifies the myogenic cells from the cell mixture, and then continuously grows the myogenic cells in vitro. In addition, using our “quality control” methods, we were able to determine the “cell quality”, including the proliferative and differentiation capability in each step of the primary culture. Furthermore, to mimic native bovine meat, the quality-controlled bovine myogenic cells were cultured on a micropatterned thermoresponsive substrate stimulating a native-like aligned structure of cells, which were then transferred onto a fibrin-based gel. This gel-based culture environment promoted structural and functional maturation of the myogenic cells, resulting in the production of bovine muscle tissues with sarcomere structures, native-like membrane structures, and contractile ability. We believe that these biomimetic features of “tissue-engineered meat” are important for the production of future cultured meat, which will need native-like nutrients, texture and taste.

Mass transport limitations (nutrients, oxygen, waste diffusion) of macroscale 3D tissue culture are circumvented by initially culturing murine or porcine adipocytes in 2D, after which bulk fat is produced by mechanically harvesting and aggregating the lipid-filled adipocytes into 3D fats using alginate or transglutaminase binders. The 3D fats were visually similar to fat tissue harvested from animals, with matching textures based on uniaxial compression tests. The mechanical properties of cultured fat tissues were based on binder choice and concentration, and changes in the fatty acid compositions of cellular triacylglyceride and phospholipids were observed after lipid supplementation (soybean oil) during in vitro culture. This approach of aggregating individual adipocytes into a bulk 3D tissue provides a scalable and versatile strategy to produce cultured fat tissue for food-related applications, thereby addressing a key obstacle in cultivated meat production. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.",,"Cultivated Meat Library,Deep dive: Cultivated meat end products",,,,Glycine max,,2022,,,2022.06.08.495192,,,2022-06-14,,,,10.1101/2022.06.08.495192,,,,,en,,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,2022-08-26,2023-01-30

Potential applications of fish muscle cell lines in cellular aquaculture have raised the importance of developing and characterizing these cell lines. In vitro models, such as the mouse C2C12 cell line, have been extremely useful for expanding knowledge about molecular mechanisms of muscle growth and differentiation in mammals. Such studies are in an infancy stage in teleost due to the unavailability of equivalent permanent muscle cell lines, except a few fish muscle cell lines that have not yet been used for cellular aquaculture. The Prospect of cell-based aquaculture relies on the development of appropriate muscle cells, optimization of cell conditions, and mass production of cells in bioreactors.

Commercial microcarriers (MCs), such as Cytodex®1, enable extensive cell expansion by offering a large surface-to-volume ratio. However, the cell-dissociation step post cell expansion makes the cell expansion less efficient. A solution is using food-grade MCs made of sustainable raw materials that do not require a dissociation step and can be included in the final meat product. This study aimed to produce food-grade MCs from food industry by-products (i.e., turkey collagen and eggshell membrane) and testing their ability to expand bovine MuSCs in spinner flask systems for eight days. The MCs’ physical properties were characterized, followed by analyzing the cell adhesion, growth, and metabolic activity. All MCs had an interconnected porous structure. Hybrid MCs composed of eggshell membrane and collagen increased the mechanical hardness and stabilized the buoyancy compared to pure collagen MCs. The MuSCs successively attached and covered the entire surface of all MCs while expressing high cell proliferation, metabolic activity, and low cell cytotoxicity. Cytodex®1 MCs were included in the study. Relative gene expression of skeletal muscle markers showed reduced PAX7 and increased MYF5, together with augmented proliferation marker MKI67 indicated activated and proliferating MuSCs on all MCs. Furthermore, the expression pattern of cell adhesion receptors (ITGb5 and SDC4) and focal adhesion marker VCL varied between the distinct MCs, indicating different specific cell receptor interactions with the various biomaterials.

Nonetheless, this method has not yet been applied in one of the most important – and well studied – decapod crustacean aquaculture species, the giant freshwater prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii. We thus established two CRISPR platforms for M. rosenbergii—the first through direct injection into early-stage embryos (entire organism genome editing) and the second by electroporation of a primary embryonic cell culture. The systems were calibrated by optimizing Cas9 concentrations, delivery methods and editing efficiencies. Editing patterns utilizing multiple guides were examined through next generation sequencing. Our results showed a wide range of editing efficiencies in embryos, in some cases reaching as high as 100%. In contrast, in primary embryonic cell cultures, the highest editing efficiency obtained reached a maximum of 64%. In addition, there was a striking difference between the two platforms in terms of the pattern of deletions around the Cas9 cut site. This finding suggests distinct repair mechanisms in the two systems, which calls for further clarification.

We also found that PPARgamma2-overexpressing BEFS cells (BEFS-PPARgamma2) grown in ADCM with or without the PPARgamma2 ligand, troglitazone, preferentially differentiate into adipogenic cells in the presence of ectopic MyoD expression. Ectopic expression of PPARgamma2 in the inducible MyoD-overepxressing BEFS cells (BEFS-TetOn-MyoD) completely suppresses myogenic differentiation and leads to a significant increase in adipogenic differentiation, suggesting that the adipogenic differentiation program might be dominant.

However, most available methodologies lack the ability to create multi-layered concentric conduits inside natural extracellular matrices (ECMs) and gels that replicate more accurately the hierarchical architecture of biological blood vessels. In this work, we present a new microfluidic nozzle design capable of multi-axial extrusion in order to 3D print and pattern bi- and tri-layered hollow channel structures. This nozzle allows, for the first time, for these structures to be embedded within layers of gels and ECMs in a fast, simple and low-cost manner. By varying flow rates (1-6 ml min-1), printspeeds (1-16 m min-1), and material concentration (25-175 mM and 1.5%-2.5% for calcium chloride and alginate, respectively) we are able to accurately determine the operational printing range as well as achieve a wide range of conduit dimensions (0.69-2.31 mm) that can be printed within a few seconds. Our scalable design allows for multi-axial extrusion and versatility in material incorporation in order to create heterogeneous structures. We demonstrate the ability to print distinct concentric layers of different cell types, namely endothelial cells and fibroblasts. By incorporating various layers of different cell-friendly materials (such as collagen and fibrin) alongside materials with high mechanical strength (i.e. alginate), we were able to increase long-term cell viability and growth without compromising the structural integrity. In this way, we can improve cellular adhesion in our biocompatible constructs as well as allow them to remain structurally sound.

Using this experimental optimization algorithm, we were able to design media with 181% more cells than a common commercial variant with similar economic cost, while doing so in 38% fewer experiments than an efficient design-of-experiments method. The optimal medium generalized well to long-term growth up to four passages of C2C12 cells, indicating the multi-information source assay improved measurement robustness relative to rapid growth assays alone.

We provide an assessment of the global situation, and discuss current research, industrial and governmental efforts to tackle the impending worldwide food crisis. We also survey the companies and start-ups working in the field (over 170 worldwide), their particular activity within the field and their sources of funding.

Flavonoids are a class of plant secondary metabolites with various biological activities, but their effects on the regulation of myoblast behaviors are a lack of study. In this study, we selected four representative flavonoids including luteolin, chrysin, apigenin, and genistein, and investigated their effects on porcine myoblasts in the aspects of proliferation, migration, and differentiation. The results showed that four flavonoids all had relatively low cell toxicity but weak ability to promote the proliferation of porcine myoblasts. A positive effect of luteolin was observed in the migration and differentiation of porcine myoblasts, as indicated by improved migration rate and fusion index, as well as upregulated expression of Myogenin and MyHC. Pharmacological inhibition of PI3K activity attenuated the efficacy of luteolin on porcine myoblasts, and further analysis showed that luteolin increased the phosphorylation of PI3K, Akt, and mTOR, indicating the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.

The current muscle units are suffering from over-simplified constructions and complicated fabrication approaches. Thus, we proposed a kind of helical micromotor with the technique of microfluidics to build tissue constructions for muscle tissue engineering. The desired micromotors were achieved by encapsulating muscle cells together with magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe3O4 NPs) in helical microfibers with biocompatible materials. The helical structures and encapsulated Fe3O4 NPs imparted micromotors with the capacity of advancing in rotation under magnetic fields; while biocompatible components made it possible for cell adhesion, proliferation, and migration. By adjusting the intensity of magnetic fields, the helical pitch of microfibers, or/and the concentration of Fe3O4 NPs, the movement speed of the achieved micromotors could be changed correspondingly. Benefiting from the controllable movement and sufficient cell cultivation, the generated micromotors were capable of assembling together to form a cell mass construction in a relatively safe and convenient environment. Furtherly, fibroblasts could be cultured on the surface of the assembled cell units to achieve complex muscle tissue structures, which would be more similar to in vivo tissue units. These characteristics indicated that the desired helical micromotors had a great application prospect in tissue regeneration, artificial muscle, cell cultured meat and other fields.",micromotor; microfluidics; muscle tissue engineering; microfiber,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2022,447,,137455,Chem.

The scaffold can support cell attachment and proliferation to create 3D engineered porcine muscle tissue. The differentiation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) was induced by a low serum medium to produce more extracellular matrix proteins. After differentiation, it was found that peanut wire-drawing protein scaffolds could be used for porcine smooth muscle cell adhesion and growth.

The developed bioink exhibited excellent shear-thinning behavior (n < 1) and mechanical stability during 3D bioprinting. Commercial proteases (Alcalase, Neutrase, and Flavourzyme) were used for protein hydrolysis. The resulting hydrolysates exhibited lower-molecular-weight bands (12-50 kDa) than those of crude isolates (55-160 kDa), as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The degree of hydrolysis was higher in the presence of Alcalase for both plant (34%) and insect (62%) PHs than other enzymes. The 3D-printed hydrogel scaffolds displayed excellent bioactivity and stability after 7 days of incubation.

Raising animals for meat production have led to some negative effects like global public health, environmental pollution, energy consumption, and animal welfare concerns. Compared to conventional animal agriculture, cultured meat is more sustainable, environmentally friendly, nutrition precision, and it can lessen the animal welfare concerns in the future. Although cultured meat is considered to supple or even replace conventional meat, it is still in its early stages and faces many challenges which need to be resolved before being on the market. Muscle is a well-organized but also intrinsically complex tissue. Benefiting from the extensive research on tissue engineering, it has already been successfully used for generation of bio-artificial muscles to repair muscle injury, but it has never been used for generation of meat. To fully mimic conventional meat's texture, flavor and nutritional properties, applications of tissue engineering technology and biomaterials are required. This review details the benefits and challenges of cultured meat with regard to isolation and purification of stem cells, long-term and large-scale culture of stem cells in an undifferentiated state, and efficient myogenic differentiation of stem cells. Given the vital important role that biomaterials play in fabricating muscle fibers, this review provides in-depth analysis of highlighting promising scaﬀold materials that can be applied to develop cultivated meat. Especially combining some precursors into edible synthetic scaffolds could create functional scaffolds that promote stem cell multilineage differentiation and thereby improve the ﬂavor of the ﬁnal meat product.

It involves cell harvesting and expansion, differentiation into myotubes, construction into muscle fibres and meat structuring. We isolated 5.3 МС 104 porcine muscle stem cells from 1 g of neonatal pig muscle tissue. According to calculations, we need to expand muscle stem cells 106-107 times to produce 100 g or 1 kg of cultured meat. However, the cells gradually lost the ability to express stemness and mature muscle cell markers (PAX7, MyHC). To tackle this critical issue and maintain cell function during cell expansion, we found that long-term culture with (100 л_M) l-Ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (Asc-2P) accelerated cell proliferation while preserving the muscle cell differentiation. We further optimized a scalable PDMS mold. Porcine muscle stem cells formed structurally-organized myotubes similar to muscle fibres in the mold. Asc-2P enhanced porcine muscle cells grown as 3D tissue networks that can produce a relatively large 3D tissue networks as cultured meat building blocks, which showed improved texture and amino acid content.

A physical cross-linking method based on water annealing was developed for the fabrication of porous glutenin sponges and fibrous aligned scaffolds. The pore sizes ranged from 50 to 250 л_m, with compressive modulus ranges from 0.5 to 1.9 kPa, depending on the percentage of glutenin (2%-5%) used in the process. The sponges were stable in PBS with refrigeration for at least six months after water annealing. The glutenin scaffolds supported the proliferation and differentiation of C2C12 mouse skeletal myoblasts and bovine satellite cells (BSCs) without the need to add specific cell adhesive proteins or other coatings. The low cost and food safe production process avoided the use of toxic cross-linkers and animal-derived extracellular matrix (ECM) coatings, suggesting that this as approach is a promising system for scaffolds useful in cultivated meat applications.",Cultured meat; Wheat glutenin; Scaffold; Cellular agriculture; Extracellular matrix; Myoblasts,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,"Bos taurus,Triticum",,2022,285,,121543,Biomaterials,,2022-06,,0142-9612,1878-5905,10.1016/j.biomaterials.2022.121543,35533444,,,"Department of Biomedical Engineering, Tufts University, 4 Colby St., Medford, 02155, Massachusetts, USA.

As a result, the acceptance and perception of cultured meat have received considerable attention in consumer research. However, only few comparisons to meat or meat alternatives have been made, which makes it unclear how cultured meat compares to these products. This is the first study to directly compare cultured meat to plant-based meat alternatives (PBMA), fish, insects, and conventional meat. Dutch consumers (n = 288) evaluated their perception and willingness to consume (WTC) patties made from the five sources listed above. Consumer segmentation based on the WTC ratings was performed, and the resulting clusters were compared in terms of their preferences, perception of cultured meat, and demographic and psychographic variables. To see if naming affected consumers' cultured meat perception, respondents were assigned to one of five naming conditions for cultured meat. The clusters analysis yielded three clusters, two of which showed moderate WTC cultured meat. The first cluster could be characterized as ""meat lovers."" Their WTC was strongest for conventional meat, followed by cultured meat, and tastiness was their main driver of WTC. The second cluster's preference was fish, followed by PBMA, with naturalness, safety, and tastiness being their drivers of WTC. The third cluster's highest WTC was for PBMA, followed by cultured meat. Among their drivers of WTC were healthiness, sustainability, and animal friendliness. Psychographic variables were highly valuable in explaining the clusters. Finally, no effects of naming for cultured meat were observed.

In this paper, we studied the potential impact of the meat production system transition on jobs. Using a survey, we compared opinions regarding the impact on jobs in Brazil, the United States and Europe, according to alternative protein experts. Our results showed the potential of plant-based and cultivated meat production to create new and higher-skilled jobs. The data analysis also suggested that the impact of novel food production systems on jobs in conventional meat production may be different for each stage of the value chain. In particular, the results showed a pressure point on animal farmers, who may be most affected in a fast transition scenario. Considering the studied geographical contexts, Brazilian professionals were more optimistic about the potential of plant-based and cultivated meat production to create new jobs.

In addition, MYH1F is a member of the MYH gene family, which plays an important role in skeletal muscle and non-muscle cells of animals, but the specific expression and function of this gene in chickens are still unknown. Therefore, qRT-PCR was used to detect the expression of MYH1F in different tissues of chicken. Proliferation and differentiation of chicken skeletal muscle satellite cells (SMSCs) have been detected by transfection of MYH1F-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA). The results showed that the expression of MYH1F in chicken skeletal muscle was higher than that in other tissues. Combined with CCK-8 assay, EdU assay, immunofluorescence, and Western blot Assay, it was found that MYH1F knockdown could significantly suppress the proliferation of chicken SMSCs and depress the differentiation and fusion of the cells.

Methods: To achieve the objective proposed, we carried out an experimental study to understand the relationships between conventional meat substitutes (cultivated meat, plant and insect-based meat) and the purchase intention, the mediating effect of negative affect (aversion, danger, and disgust) and the moderating effect of neophobia. Originality/Relevance: Little is known about the low acceptance of conventional meat substitutes; therefore, this study presents a unique explanation mechanism for this fact, as well as an intensification moderator. Results: Negative affect explains the low intention to buy insect-based meat, and high levels of neophobia are a moderator only in the direct relationship for all meat substitutes.

This study aims to replace or reduce the typical 10% serum application in fish cell culture media by applying protein hydrolysates from insects and marine invertebrate species for the growth of Zebrafish embryonic stem cells (ESC) as the model organism. Protein hydrolysates were produced from Black soldier fly (BSF), cricket, oyster, mussel, and lugworm with high protein content, suitable functional properties, adequate amino acids composition, and the degree of hydrolysis from 18.24 to 33.52%. Protein hydrolysates at low concentrations from 0.001 to 0.1 mg/mL in combination with 1 and 2.5% serum significantly increased cell growth compared to the control groups (5 and 10% serum) (P < 0.05). All protein hydrolysates with concentrations of 1 and 10 mg/mL were found to be toxic to cells and significantly reduced cell growth and performance (P < 0.05). However, except for cricket, all hydrolysates were able to restore or significantly increase cell growth and viability with 50% less serum at a concentration of 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1 mg/mL. Although cell growth was enhanced at lower concentrations of protein hydrolysates, cell morphology was altered due to the lack of serum. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity results indicated that BSF and lugworm hydrolysates did not alter the cell membrane. In addition, light and fluorescence imaging revealed that cell morphological features were comparable to the 10% serum control group. Overall, lugworm and BSF hydrolysates reduced serum by up to 90% while preserving excellent cell health. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.",,"Cultivated Meat Library,PISCES/ATLAS",,,,Danio rerio,,2022,,,2022.10.01.510438,,,2022-10-05,,,,10.1101/2022.10.01.510438,,,,,en,,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,2023-01-12,2023-01-30

We conducted an online questionnaire survey (N = 5,000) with respondents from all over Japan. Results showed that social acceptance of plant-based meat was the highest (70.2%), followed by microalgae (57.8%) and milk alternatives (50.8%) and social acceptance of insect protein was the lowest (19.5%), followed by cultured meat (40.9%). Our comparative analysis of image associations showed that insect protein had a distinctly negative image among the alternative proteins. Further, our survey found that the level of scientific interest was the critical common factor in determining the attitudes toward these foods. Daily consumption of foods, age and gender affected the attitudes toward various alternative proteins. More than 40.0% of participants wanted labeling regulation for all alternative proteins by the government, in a relatively similar pattern among different types of alternative proteins. Our results would contribute to understanding public attitudes toward alternative proteins, which is helpful in practicing science communication for the meat industry, food sectors, and policymakers.",alternative proteins; insects; plant-based meats; milk alternatives; microalgae; cultured meats,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2023,105,,104787,Food Qual.

However, this novel method of producing meat is currently being met by consumer hesitancy due to perceptions of unnaturalness and feelings of disgust. While prior research has shown that appeal positioning based on naturalness and ethicality, for example, may enhance the acceptance of clean meat, these findings are limited because prior research has only examined different appeals in isolation, and no research has explored the psychological mechanism underlying the effect of these appeals. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine how a joint appeal based on both natural and ethical aspects of clean meat is more effective in enhancing consumer preference. Specifically, two experiments were conducted among participants from the US (n = 302) and the UK (n = 303) to examine whether a joint appeal is more effective than a single appeal focusing on either naturalness or ethicality, and no appeal. Extending the current literature, our findings show that the joint appeal increases the effectiveness of the communication, with participants in this condition showing a significantly higher preference toward the product when compared to those in the single-appeal or no-appeal conditions. The results also demonstrate that disgust and compassion underlie the effect of the joint appeal on consumer preference.

The peptide sequence in all four lipopeptides contains the integrin cell adhesion RGDS motif, and the cytocompatibility of the lipopeptides is also analyzed. Lipopeptides have either tetradecyl (C14, myristyl) or hexadecyl (C16, palmitoyl) lipid chains and peptide sequence WGGRGDS or GGGRGDS, that is, with either a tryptophan-containing WGG or triglycine GGG tripeptide spacer between the bioactive peptide motif and the alkyl chain. All four lipopeptides self-assemble above a critical aggregation concentration (CAC), determined through several comparative methods using circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence. Spectroscopic methods [CD and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy] show the presence of β-sheet structures, consistent with the extended nanotape, helical ribbon, and nanotube structures observed by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM). The high-quality cryo-TEM images clearly show the coexistence of helically twisted ribbon and nanotube structures for C14-WGGRGDS, which highlight the mechanism of nanotube formation by the closure of the ribbons. Small-angle X-ray scattering shows that the nanotapes comprise highly interdigitated peptide bilayers, which are also present in the walls of the nanotubes. Hydrogel formation was observed at sufficiently high concentrations or could be induced by a heat/cool protocol at lower concentrations. Birefringence due to nematic phase formation was observed for several of the lipopeptides, along with spontaneous flow alignment of the lyotropic liquid crystal structure in capillaries. Cell viability assays were performed using both L929 fibroblasts and C2C12 myoblasts to examine the potential uses of the lipopeptides in tissue engineering, with a specific focus on application to cultured (lab-grown) meat, based on myoblast cytocompatibility. Indeed, significantly higher cytocompatibility of myoblasts was observed for all four lipopeptides compared to that for fibroblasts, in particular at a lipopeptide concentration below the CAC. Cytocompatibility could also be improved using hydrogels as cell supports for fibroblasts or myoblasts. Our work highlights that precision control of peptide sequences using bulky aromatic residues within ""linker sequences"" along with alkyl chain selection can be used to tune the self-assembled nanostructure.

Nevertheless, the application of 3D printing in meat still faces many challenges. The rheological properties of the ink, such as shear thinning behavior, viscosity, and yield stress, are critical in determining whether it can be printed smoothly and ensuring the quality of the product. Meat materials are complex multi-phase colloidal systems with unique fibrous structures that cannot be printed directly, and improving the printability of meat colloids mainly limits meat printing. The complexity of meat colloidal systems determines the different heat requirements. In addition, at this stage, the functionality of the printer and the formulation of a single nutritional and organoleptic properties limit the implementation and application of 3D printing. Moreover, the development of cultured meat, the full application of by-products, and the emergence of new technologies provides opportunities for the application of 3D printing in the meat industry.

Cultivated meat is a rapidly advancing technology that produces meat products by proliferating and differentiating animal stem cells in large bioreactors, avoiding conventional live-animal farming. While many companies are working in this area, there is a lack of existing infrastructure and experience at commercial scale, resulting in many technical bottlenecks such as scale-up of cell culture and media availability and costs. In this study, we evaluate theoretical cultivated beef production facilities with the goal of envisioning an industry with multiple facilities to produce in total 100,000,000 kg of cultured beef per year or ~0.14% of the annual global beef production. Using the computer-aided process design software, SuperPro Designer®, facilities are modelled to create a comprehensive techno-economic analysis (TEA) to highlight improvements that can lower the cost of such a production system and allow cultivated meat products to be competitive. Three facility scenarios are presented with different sized production reactors; ~42,000 L stirred tank bioreactor (STR) with a base case cost of goods sold (COGS) of $35/kg, ~211,000 L STR with a COGS of $25/kg, and ~262,000 L airlift reactor (ALR) with a COGS of $17/kg.

The main raw material for the production of cultured meat is muscle stem cells called satellite cells isolated from livestock. However, how to mass proliferate and maintain satellite cells in vitro without genetic manipulation remains unclear. In the present study, we isolated and purified porcine muscle satellite cells (PMSCs) from the femur of a 1-day-old piglet and cultured PMSCs by treating them with an inhibitor (XAV939, Tankyrase (TNKS) inhibitor) or an activator (CHIR99021, glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) inhibitor) of Wnt signaling. The CHIR group treated with 3 μM CHIR99021 showed a significantly increased proliferation rate of PMSCs compared to the SC group (control), whereas the XAV group treated with 1 μM XAV939 showed a significantly decreased proliferation rate of PMSCs. CHIR99021 also inhibited the differentiation of PMSCs by reducing the expression of MyoD while maintaining the expression of Pax7 and suppressed apoptosis by regulating the expression of apoptosis-related proteins and genes. RNA sequencing was performed to obtain gene expression profiles following inhibition or activation of the Wnt signaling pathway and various signaling mechanisms related to the maintenance of satellite cells were identified.

Under most existing culture systems, the content and maturity of in vitro generated myotubes are insufficient, limiting the application and public acceptance of cultured meat. Here we demonstrated that a natural compound, naringenin (NAR), promoted myogenic differentiation of porcine satellite cells (PSCs) in vitro and increased the content and maturity of generated myotubes, especially for PSCs that had undergone extensive expansion. Mechanistically, NAR upregulated the IGF-1/AKT/mTOR anabolic pathway during the myogenesis of PSCs by activating the estrogen receptor β. Moreover, PSCs were mixed with hydrogels and cultured in a mold with parallel micro-channels to manufacture cultured pork samples. More mature myosin was detected, and obvious sarcomere was observed when the differentiation medium was supplemented with NAR. Taken together, these findings suggested that NAR induced the differentiation of PSCs and generation of mature myotubes through upregulation of the IGF-1 signaling, contributing to the development of efficient and innovative cultured meat production systems.",IGF-1; cultured meat; differentiation medium; estrogen receptor β; flavonoids; myogenesis; naringenin; porcine satellite cells; public acceptance,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,Sus scrofa,,2022,11,23,3755,Foods,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,2022-11-22,,2304-8158,2304-8158,10.3390/foods11233755,36496566,PMC9738036,,"Key Laboratory of Industrial Biotechnology, Ministry of Education, Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214122, China.

This study assessed the impact of the name and packaging color of cultured meat on consumers' behavioral intentions toward its consumption in Italy. With the assumption that names and packaging colors affect consumers' acceptance differently, according to their characteristics and food neophobia, this study used a finite mixture model to analyze the stimulus impacts across different groups of consumers. The results showed that food neophobia plays a relevant role in individual response to name and packaging color of cultured meat.

However, this potential can only be realized if cultured meat penetrates the mass-market, which renders consumer acceptance a critical bottleneck. Using structural equation modeling, the present paper investigates the role of hitherto neglected organizational factors (trustworthiness, corporate social responsibility (CSR), and extrinsic motives) as antecedents of consumer acceptance of cultured meat. To this end, a pre-post intervention design in terms of a two-part online questionnaire was used with the final sample consisting of 966 participants.

Fat plays a key role in the meat flavor; therefore, development of suitable adipogenic protocols for livestock is essential. The traditional adipogenic cocktail containing IBMX, dexamethasone, insulin and rosiglitazone is not food-compatible. Here, we demonstrate that of the four inducers only insulin and rosiglitazone are necessary in both serum-free (DMAD) and serum-containing media, with DMAD outperforming FBS. Two glucocorticoid receptor activators, progesterone and hydrocortisone, found in DMAD and FBS, affect differentiation homogeneity, without playing an essential role in activating adipogenic genes.

Some meat-reducers opt to feed plant-based diets to companion animals, but others express reservations. Cultivated meat offers a possible third path, but consumer perceptions of cultivated meat as pet food have received little scholarly attention. Using survey data from 729 respondents, we analyzed consumers' willingness to feed cultivated meat to companion animals, particularly with reference to their own current dietary practices, and their own willingness to eat cultivated meat. Though not all our respondents willing to eat cultivated meat were willing to feed it to their companions, a large majority were (81.4%, 193/237). However, for those unwilling to eat cultivated meat, the story was more complicated. Vegans and vegetarians were less likely to say they would eat cultivated meat (16.4%, 39/238) than meat-eating respondents (40.3%, 198/491). However, among vegans and vegetarians who would not consume cultivated meat, the majority (55.9%, 86/154) indicated that they would still feed it to their pets. Among meat-eating respondents, only a small minority (9.6%, 11/114) unwilling to eat cultivated meat would feed it to their pets. Consequently, we suggest that the potential market for cultivated meat for pet food is markedly different from the potential market for cultivated meat from human consumption. A key concern among our respondents about feeding cultivated meat to pets was a worry that it was not healthy, indicating that there may be easy gains in cultivated pet food's uptake through messaging relating to safety and nutritional completeness.",,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2022,17,12,e0275009,PLoS One,,2022-12-30,,1932-6203,,10.1371/journal.pone.0275009,36584123,PMC9803157,,"Faculty of Health and Wellbeing, University of Winchester, Winchester, United Kingdom.

However, there is little empirical evidence for how frequent food consumption declines are when alternative foods are introduced, limiting our knowledge of the potential for such introductions to drive food system transformations. Using 53 years of food supply data for 99 crop, livestock, and seafood commodities in 159 countries, we use regression analyses on 12 883 time series—each representing a single country-commodity pair—to detect sustained declines in apparent national food consumption, as well as corresponding consumption increases of other food commodities. First, we show that sustained declines in the consumption of any food item are rare, occurring in 9.6% of time series. Where declines are present, they most frequently occur in traditional plant-based staples, e.g. starchy roots, and are larger compared to animal-source foods, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where much of the future increase in food demand is expected to occur. Second, although declines were rare, we found national production rather than trade was identified as the most common proximate driver of declines in consumption, suggesting that shifts in diets have the potential to translate into reduced environmental impacts from food production. Third, we found consumption increases were nearly twice as common as declines, but only 8% of declines (from within 4% of total time series) occurred parallel to incline events within the same food group, suggesting limited interchangeability. An examination of case studies suggests that alternative foods can facilitate food system transitions, but strong relative disadvantages for existing foods across aspects of technology, markets, policy and culture need to exist in parallel to support for alternative foods across the same factors. Where existing foods are already produced in highly efficient systems, a lack of systematic disadvantage may provide a barrier to alternative foods driving change.",,Cultivated Meat Library,CC BY,,,,,2021,17,1,014020,Environ.

The terms 'cell-cultured' and 'cell-cultivated' were the best all round labels in terms of clarity, appeal, and communicating safety and allergenicity - in particular, the addition of the prefix 'cell-' increased understanding compared to 'cultured' or 'cultivated' labels.

As an initial step toward a thorough demonstration of safety, this review identifies hazards that could be introduced during manufacturing, evaluates applicability of existing safety assessment approaches, and highlights research priorities that could support safe commercialization. Input was gathered from members of the cultured meat and seafood industry, researchers, regulators, and food safety experts. A series of workshops were held with 87 industry representatives and researchers to create a modular manufacturing process diagram, which served as a framework to identify potential chemical and biological hazards along the steps of the manufacturing process that could affect the safety of a final food product. Interviews and feedback on draft documents validated the process diagram and supported hazard identification and evaluation of applicable safety methods. Most hazards are not expected to be novel; therefore, safety assessment methods from a range of fields, such as conventional and novel foods, foods produced from biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, and so forth, are likely to be applicable. However, additional assessment of novel inputs or products with significant differences from existing foods may be necessary.

Here, we present a set of expression constructs and a simplified protocol for recombinant production of functionally active GFs, including FGF-2, IGF-1, PDGF-BB and TGF-β1 in Escherichia coli . Using this expression system, we produced soluble GFs from species including bovine, chicken, and fish.

Bioreactor designs were adapted from other bioprocesses to account for the high cell densities and final yield necessary to commercialize cultivated meat. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models are useful tools to analyze the bioreactor performance (e.g., predicting shear stress, turbulence, and oxygen transfer rate) for better bioreactors design so that cell growth can be optimized. This review assesses the CFD models for seven types of bioreactors – stirred tank, wave/rocking, hollow-fiber, fluidized bed, airlift, rotary wall, and high-aspect ratio vessel –and compares strengths and weaknesses of the approaches taken. Traditional approaches include single-phase flow, k-ε turbulence models, and simplified water-like material properties to simulate bioreactor performance. Recent research has focused on using Large Eddy Simulations (LES) and multiphase flow to develop more accurate and robust models. Strategies that can improve CFD model development include incorporating dynamic rheological properties, simulating multiple phases to account for cells and microcarriers, compartmentalizing to speed up simulations, and integrating with micro-scale cell growth models.",Cultivated meat; Bioreactors; Computational fluid dynamics; Mammalian cell culture; Microcarriers,"Cultivated Meat Library,Papers by GFI grantees",,,,,,2022,6,,100195,Future Foods,,2022-12-01,,2666-8335,,10.1016/j.fufo.2022.100195,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023-01-12,2023-01-13

In this method, living cells are incorporated within bioinks, extruded layer by layer into a granular support material followed by gelation of the bioink through diverse cross-linking mechanisms. This approach offers high fidelity and precise fabrication of complex structures mimicking living tissue properties. However, the transition of cell mass mixed with the bioink into functional native-like tissue requires post-printing cultivation in vitro. An often-overlooked drawback of 3D bioprinting is the nonuniform shrinkage and deformation of printed constructs during the post-printing tissue maturation period, leading to highly variable engineered constructs with unpredictable size and shape. This limitation poses a challenge for the technology to meet applicative requirements. A novel technology of ""print-and-grow,"" involving 3D bioprinting and subsequent cultivation in κ-Carrageenan-based microgels (CarGrow) for days is presented. CarGrow enhances the long-term structural stability of the printed objects by providing mechanical support. Moreover, this technology provides a possibility for live imaging to monitor tissue maturation. The ""print-and-grow"" method demonstrates accurate bioprinting with high tissue viability and functionality while preserving the construct's shape and size.",3D bioprinting; bioink; contraction; support material; tissue engineering; κ-Carrageenan,"Cultivated Meat Library,Deep dive: Cultivated meat scaffolding part A,Deep dive: Cultivated meat scaffolding part B",CC BY,,,,,2022,9,34,e2200882,Adv.

By focusing on the introduction of plant-based and cultured meat, a novel dataset involving 3441 research participants was collected in China through the online platform with randomized controlled experiments. The results show that for promotion-focused participants, gain-oriented message is effective while avoidance-oriented message is not in improving their acceptance of artificial meat. For prevention-focused participants, both gain- and avoidance-oriented messages are found to increase their acceptance of artificial meat effectively. To quantify the average impacts of environmental-related message and consumers' regulatory focus fit on the acceptance of plant-based meat and cultured meat, a seemingly unrelated regression model is applied. The results reveal that for a randomly selected individual, exposing with both gain- and avoidance-oriented messages would increase his or her acceptance of artificial meat comparing to exposing with neutral message.

Moreover, more profound knowledge on food-safety aspects, like microbial contamination, prions, possible genetically engineered starting material, etc., and ways to reduce such risks will determine the future success of cultured meat products.

The purity of the cells was confirmed by staining paired box protein 7 (Pax7) after proliferation, and Pax7 expression was the highest in culture flasks shaken for 2 hours after incubation at 41°C for 2 hours to prevent the attachment of satellite cells (p<0.05). Also, when pre-plating and proliferation were performed at 37°C and 41°C, the Pax7 expression rate was higher at 41°C. The differentiation capabilities of the three groups (T3, T6, and T7) with high Pax7 expression were compared and the fusion index (%) and myotube formation area (%) determined by myosin heavy chain (MHC) staining was calculated. The T6 and T7 groups, which were cultured at 41°C, showed significantly higher values than the T3 group (p<0.05). There was no significant difference in the expression of Pax7 and MHC between the T6 and T7 groups (p>0.05). These results suggest that pre-plating at 41°C for a total of 4 hours was the most efficient in terms of cost and time for purifying chicken satellite cells for cultured meat.

Stem cells were cultured in a bioreactor in the presence of serum to grow the flesh to maturity. Cultured meat technology originated from regenerative medical technology; however, it has been given a new lease of life to produce cultured meat as an innovative food source in the future without involving cattle breeding. This technology can reduce the negative environmental impacts of global warming, water use, soil, and unethical handling of animals. In the excitement of accepting this new technology, the halal status of cultured meat is in question, as it can be produced from embryonic stem cells and myosatellite cells, each of which can be disputed for their halal status. Additionally, the process of culturing and maturation of stem cells involves the use of an impure medium derived from animal blood. Thus, cultured meat is acceptable to Muslims only if the stem cells, medium and scaffold biomaterials used to manufacture it are from Halal sources and shall be in line with the six principles discussed in this study. The discussion is based on Halal and haram animals; Animal slaughtering; Not derived from a source of najs (impurity); Istihalah tammah (perfect substance change); Maslahah (public interest or benefit) and mafsadah (damage); and Darurat (exigency) of cultured meat)).",Clean meat; Cultured meat; Halal status; In vitro meat; Laboratory grown meat; Science and Islam perspective,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2023,30,1,103501,Saudi J.

Comparing existing life cycle analyses for marine capture fish, aquaculture harvested fish, and cell-based meat, this article highlights challenges for the cellular mariculture industry that will need to be addressed before the technology can be considered anything more than a small-scale boutique technology for high income countries. While the industry has expressed concerns over regulatory approvals, the bigger challenges for the industry will be addressing energy usage, feedstock and culture medium sourcing, and general equity concerns.

Muscle stem cells are regarded as important seed cells for generating muscle fiber in vitro because of their proliferative and myogenic differentiation potential. However, current approaches for the isolation and purification of muscle stem cells are low-yield and high-cost, limiting the industrial production of cultured meat. Here, we reported an efficient and economical protease combination consisting of pronase and dispase II for the isolation of primary muscle stem cells, achieving 5.06 ± 0.12 × 106 nucleated cells and 3.19 ± 0.19 × 106 Pax7+ cells from 1 g of porcine muscle tissue. Furthermore, by investigating the effect of initial purity on the proliferation and differentiation potential of muscle stem cells, we found that higher purity of initial muscle stem cells promoted the maintenance of myogenic properties of cells after expansion but reduced the total number of obtained cells. Based on nucleated cells isolated from 1 g of porcine muscle, muscle stem cells purified by 0.5 h of pre-plating yielded 2.19 ± 0.16 × 108 cells with myogenic differentiation capacity after 20 days of expansion, which was 5-fold higher than those purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Therefore, a modified approach was developed to obtain porcine muscle stem cells for cultured meat production, involving tissue digestion with the pronase and dispase II combination and purification through pre-plating for 0.5 h. This approach was simple, efficient, and economic, which would facilitate the industrial production of cultured meat.",Cultured meat; Isolation; Porcine muscle; Pre-plating; Protease combination; Purification,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,Sus scrofa,,2022,162,Pt B,112206,Food Res.

Cultured meat, which is obtained from stem cells using tissue engineering techniques, has been described as a potential alternative to the current meat production systems, which have extensive negative effects. To ensure that a food product is safe for human consumption, it is important to consider all aspects of its life cycle.

New agricultural practices are being advocated in order to achieve food security and face environmental challenges. Cultivated meat has recently been considered one of the most desired alternatives by animal rights advocates because it promises to ensure nutrition for all people while dramatically reducing ecological impacts and animal suffering. It is therefore presented as one of the fairest means of food production for the coming decades, according to utilitarian arguments. However, food security, environmental concerns and animal welfarism guided by a short-term utilitarianism could have techno-optimism bias and could result in some forms of oppression such as anthropocentrism. I argue that there are still deep-rooted moral issues in food systems that are not addressed primarily by lab-grown meat, mainly derived from a loss of sovereignty. Food practices developed in high-tech labs with artificial interventionism constrain the ability of living entities (that are used as food) to flourish on their own terms. This paper aims to explore how sovereignty entitlements for humans and nonhumans are often overlooked by advocates of cultivated meat and the moral challenges it may pose. Accordingly, a more than utilitarian approach framed by ecological and republican justice is proposed here to shed light on some pitfalls of food chains based on cellular agriculture.",Capabilities; Cultivated Meat; Eco-republicanism; Flourishing; Sovereignty; Utilitarianism,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2023,36,1,1,J.

This UK-based, quantitative study aimed to elucidate consumers' valuation of alternatives to conventional meat products. In an online study, 151 meat eaters and 44 non-meat eaters were shown pictures of meat, dairy, and bakery products, including beef burger, cheese sandwich and blueberry muffin. Each product was evaluated with three different labels (e.g., 'conventional', 'plant-based' and 'cultured' for beef burger). Participants rated expected taste pleasantness, fullness, satisfaction, healthiness, disgust and willingness-to-pay for each product/label combination. The results obtained demonstrate that alternatives to conventional meat products overall are acceptable to both meat and non-meat eaters. Although meat eaters' expected plant-based meat alternatives to be less satisfying, due to lower expected taste pleasantness and fillingness (Cohen's d = 0.14 to 0.63), they perceived the plant-based alternatives to be more healthy (d ≥ 1.18). Cultured meat products were perceived by meat eaters to be equally or more healthy, but more disgusting (d ≥ 0.41), than conventional meat products. These results suggest there is an opportunity to promote (motivate) acceptance of alternatives to conventional meat products based on their perceived healthiness, to at least partly balance reduced expected taste pleasantness and other negative attributes (i.e., barriers).",Alternatives to conventional meat; Taste pleasantness; Satisfaction; Disgust; Cultured meat,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2022,181,,106394,Appetite,,2022-11-26,,0195-6663,1095-8304,10.1016/j.appet.2022.106394,36503886,,,"Nutrition and Behaviour Unit, School of Psychological Science, University of Bristol, Bristol, BS8 1TU, UK.

Zein/hordein and zein/secalin scaffolds with highly ordered tessellated structures are successfully fabricated after optimizing printing conditions. The prolamin scaffolds demonstrated good water stability and in vitro degradability due to the porous fiber surface, which is spontaneously generated by culturing muscle cells for 1 week. Moreover, mouse skeletal myoblasts (C2C12) and porcine skeletal muscle satellite cells (PSCs) can adhere and proliferate on the fibrous matrix, and a CM slice is produced by culturing PSCs on prolamin scaffolds with high tissue similarity.

The cell line has been passaged over 100 times in 3 years and is considered immortal. Cells are reliant on serum supplementation for proliferation and exhibit a broad thermal profile comparable to the eurythermic nature of C. auratus in vivo. The impact of exogenous growth factors, including insulin-like growth factors I and II (IGF-I and IGF-II), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ), on cell morphology and proliferation was investigated. Insulin-like growth factors acted as mitogens and had minimal effect on cell morphology. TGFβ exposure resulted in CAtmus1PFR exhibiting a myofibroblast morphology becoming enlarged with actin bundling. This differentiation was confirmed through the expression of smooth muscle actin (sma), an increase in type 1 collagen (col1a) expression, and a loss of motility. Expression of col1a and sma was decreased when cells were exposed to bFGF, and no actin bundling was observed. These data indicate that CAtmus1PFR may be myofibroblastic precursor cells descending from mesenchymal progenitor cells present in the tail muscle myosepta.",Actin bundling; Australasian snapper; Cell line; Chrysophrys auratus; Collagen; Extracellular matrix; Growth factors; Mesenchymal stem cells; Myofibroblast; Pagrus auratus,"Cultivated Meat Library,PISCES/ATLAS",CC BY,CAtmus1PFR,,Pagrus auratus,,2022,,,,In Vitro Cell.

Inhibition of Tgf-β and Notch signals significantly promoted myogenic differentiation of piscine satellite cells (PSCs). The mixture of fish gelatin and sodium alginate combined with a p53 inhibitor and a Yap activator supported PSC viability and proliferation. Based on the texture of fish muscle tissue, a 3D scaffold was constructed by gelatin-based gel mixed with PSCs. After proliferation and differentiation, the muscle scaffold was filled with cultured piscine adipocytes. Finally, tissue-like fish fillets with 20×12×4 mm were formed, consisting of 5.67×107 muscles and 4.02×107 adipocytes.

Cultivated meat and seafood have been proposed as a means of mitigating the substantial harms associated with current production methods, including damage to the environment, antibiotic resistance, food security challenges, poor animal welfare, and-in the case of seafood-overfishing and ecological damage associated with fishing and aquaculture. Because biomedical tissue engineering research, from which cultivated meat draws a great deal of inspiration, has thus far been conducted almost exclusively in mammals, cultivated seafood suffers from a lack of established protocols for producing complex tissues in vitro. At the same time, fish such as the zebrafish Danio rerio have been widely used as model organisms in developmental biology. Therefore, many of the mechanisms and signaling pathways involved in the formation of muscle, fat, and other relevant tissue are relatively well understood for this species. The same processes are understood to a lesser degree in aquatic invertebrates. This review discusses the differentiation and maturation of meat-relevant cell types in aquatic species and makes recommendations for future research aimed at recapitulating these processes to produce cultivated fish and shellfish.",Cell-based seafood; Cultivated seafood; Differentiation; Fat; Muscle; Signaling,"Cultivated Meat Library,PISCES/ATLAS,Fish-entials,GFI Publications & Analyses",CC BY,,,,,2023,25,,1-29,Mar.

Solid supports that are edible can be a part of the final product, thus simplifying downstream operations in the production of fermented beverages and lab grown meat. We provide proof of concept that edible filamentous fungal pellets can function as a solid support by assessing the attachment and growth of two model cell types: yeast, and myoblast cells. The filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae was cultured to produce pellets with 0.9 mm diameter. These fugal pellets were inactivated by heat or chemical methods and characterized physicochemically. Chemically inactivated pellets had the lowest dry mass and were the most hydrophobic. Scanning electron microscope images showed that both yeast and myoblast cells naturally adhered to the fungal pellets. Over 48 h of incubation, immobilized yeast increased five-fold on active pellets and six-fold on heat-inactivated pellets. Myoblast cells proliferated best on heat-treated pellets, where viable cell activity increased almost two-fold, whereas on chemically inactivated pellets myoblasts did not increase in the cell mass.

Recently, many studies related to cultured meat have been conducted, but producing large-sized cultured meat remains a challenge. It is aimed to introduce 3D bioprinting for producing large cell aggregates for cultured meat production. A hydrogel scaffold is produced at the centimeter scale using a bioink consisting of photocrosslinkable materials for digital light processing-based (DLP) printing, which has high printing accuracy and can produce geometrically complex structures. The light exposure time for hydrogel photopolymerization by DLP bioprinting is optimized based on photorheometry and cell viability assays. Naturally immortalized bovine embryonic fibroblast cells transformed with MyoD and PPARγ2 instead of primary cells are used as the latter have difficulties in maintaining stemness and are associated with animal ethics issues. The cells are mixed into the hydrogel for printing. Myogenesis and adipogenesis are induced simply by changing the medium after printing. Scaffolds are obtained successfully with living cells and large microchannels. The cooked cultured meat maintains its size and shape upon cutting. The overall dimensions are 3.43 cm × 5.53 cm × 0.96 cm.

This study investigates distrust in scientists as a barrier to cultured meat acceptance and its interplay with positive drivers. For the latter, this study draws upon higher-order values (universalism) and domain-specific innovativeness.Design/methodology/approach This study proposes a conceptual model, which is empirically tested using an online survey of Austrian consumers (n = 509) and structural equation modelling.Findings First, this study provides empirical support for the inhibiting role of distrust in scientists on the acceptance of cultured meat. Second, universalism and domain-specific innovativeness both positively impact consumers' behavioural intentions. Third, this study finds that consumers' innovativeness mitigates the negative effect of distrust in scientists on the willingness to try cultured meat, whereas the value of universalism does not moderate this negative effect.Practical implications The findings are strategically useful for companies in the innovative food sector in terms of segmentation and targeting. For both companies and policymakers, the impeding role of distrust in scientists for technology-based food innovations depicts an aspect that might be considered relevant to be addressed.Originality/value This study adds to the current body of knowledge about consumer acceptance of technology-based food innovations, such as cultured meat, by jointly examining the relevance of human values, domain-specific innovativeness and distrust in scientists as well as their interactions to explain behavioural intentions.",,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2022,ahead-of-print,ahead-of-print,,British Food Journal,,2022-01-01,,0007-070X,,10.1108/BFJ-03-2022-0270,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023-01-12,2023-01-13

In the nascent cultivated meat industry, large-scale biomass creation will be critical given the size of demand in the conventional meat and seafood sectors. However, there are many challenges that must be overcome before cultivated meat and seafood become commercially viable including cost reductions of cell culture media, bioprocess design innovation and optimization, and scaling up in the longer term. Computational modelling and simulation can help to address many of these challenges, and can be a far cheaper and faster alternative to performing physical experiments. Computer modelling can also help researchers pinpoint system interactions that matter, and guide researchers to identify those parameters that should be changed in later designs for eventual optimization. In this work, a computational model that combines agent-based modeling and computational fluid dynamics was developed to study biomass growth as a function of the operative conditions of stirred-tank bioreactors. The focus was to analyze how the mechanical stress induced by rotor speed can influence the growth of cells attached to spherical microcarriers. The computer simulation results reproduced observations from physical experiments that high rotor speeds reduce cell growth rates and induce cell death under the high mechanical stresses induced at these stir speeds. Moreover, the results suggest that modeling both cell death and cell quiescence are required to recapitulate these observations from physical experiments.

Here, we perform spent medium analysis to compare the specific nutrient utilization of primary embryonic chicken muscle precursor cells and fibroblasts to the murine C2C12 myoblast cell line. We demonstrate that these related cell types have significantly different nutrient utilization patterns collectively and on a per-cell basis, and that many components of conventional media do not appear to be depleted by the cells. Namely, glucose was not consumed as rapidly nor as completely by the chicken muscle precursors compared to other cells overall, and there were significant differences in specific consumption rates for several other key nutrients over the first day of culture.

Järviö_2022,Järviö N,,"The planet we eat : Comparing environmental impacts of protein-rich food and feed ingredients from cellular agriculture, agriculture and aquaculture",https://helda.helsinki.fi/handle/10138/349522,Book,,"Conventional,Cultivated,Meat,Seafood",,"Environmental impacts (alternative protein),Environmental impacts (conventional protein)",,,"Advancements in agriculture and increases in the human population have led to a surge in agricultural and aquacultural production. This increase in production has come at a cost. The consequences of current food production for the environment have never been so pronounced in human history, threatening the relatively stable state in which the Earth system has remained over the past 11,700 years of the Holocene epoch. Intensive farming systems often rely heavily on external inputs such as pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers to suppress the natural process of species diversification on the land, which lead to problems such as eutrophication, soil exhaustion and desertification. Other examples of environmental impacts resulting from current agricultural practices include deforestation and land degradation leading to the loss of valuable ecosystems and biodiversity, accelerated climate change, over-extraction of groundwater, terrestrial acidification, and biological crises such as the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. To reduce the environmental impacts of the food system, the search for more sustainable protein alternatives to replace animal-based proteins is one of the foremost research topics in food science and biotechnology today. Cellular agriculture — the production of agricultural products using cell-culturing technologies — is an approach that seeks to decouple food production from conventional agricultural farming, and, therefore, has the potential to decrease the environmental burden of food production. Cell-culturing technologies usually utilize bioreactors, creating closed production processes that allow for efficient recycling of inputs, and control of emissions from the production process. Another benefit of cell-cultured products is increased resilience of the food production system towards environmental changes, due to reduced reliance on conventional agricultural inputs. However, estimates of the environmental impacts of cell-cultured foods are still mostly lacking due to the novelty of these products. The aim of this dissertation is to improve the understanding of environmental impacts of protein-rich cellular agricultural products in comparison with those of existing protein-rich food and feed ingredients originating from agricultural and aquacultural systems. The environmental impacts of protein-rich cellular agricultural products were quantified to gain an understanding of the production processes contributing most to these impacts, and how these differ from agricultural and aquacultural products. Lastly, the work presented in this dissertation seeks to explore how the environmental impacts of cellular agricultural protein products can be reduced through alterations to their production processes. However, as GHG emissions resulting from aquacultural production in mangrove forests have been systematically excluded from environmental impacts assessments, a fair comparison between protein produced by cellular agriculture and aquaculture is compromised. The work in this dissertation, therefore, additionally focuses on the development and application of a method to quantify the GHG emissions caused by LULUC of mangrove forest. The protein-rich food and feed ingredients studied were microbial protein produced using hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria (HOB) (hereafter referred to as MP) and ovalbumin produced using the Trichodora reesei fungi (Tr-OVA). Shrimp was selected on the basis that aquaculture products are often underrepresented in environmental assessment studies in contrast to their importance as a protein source for many people(Gephart et al., 2021). MP and Tr-OVA are recently developed cellular agricultural products that can be used either as food or feed ingredients and are examples of cellular (MP) and acellular (Tr-OVA) products. To address the aims of the research, the life cycle assessment (LCA) method was used. LCA allows for the quantification of inputs and outputs at all production stages throughout a product’s life cycle and the coupling of these to various environmental impact categories, such as global warming potential (GWP), land use, and eutrophication. This enables a fair comparison between different protein-rich food and feed products originating from distinctly different systems. The environmental impacts of the three protein-rich products studied were also compared to the environmental impacts of other protein-rich products found in literature. GHG emissions caused by land use and land-use change (LULUC) of mangrove forests are often overlooked in LCA studies, despite the large contribution of LULUC emissions to climate change (approximately 13% of global emissions in the year 2015). Article I, consequently, focuses on the introduction of a method to include this specific emissions source and on applying it to a case study of shrimp farming in mangrove areas. Article II quantifies the environmental impacts of MP production. MP is a single-cell protein in the form of a flour-like powder with a 65% protein content. Because MP production uses autotrophic HOB there is no reliance on any agricultural inputs. Article III investigates the environmental impacts of Tr-OVA production. Like MO, Tr-OVA is a protein-rich powder produced in bioreactors through a closed process and has a 92% protein content. However, unlike MP, its production relies on glucose from agriculture. Using modern biotechnological tools, the gene carrying the blueprint for ovalbumin (SERPINB14) is inserted into the fungus, which then starts to produce the same protein — ovalbumin — that is normally found in chicken eggs. Cell-cultured ovalbumin can be used as a direct replacement for the chicken-based egg white that is widely used in food processing. The results of this dissertation showed great potential for MP and Tr-OVA to reduce the environmental impacts associated with protein production — especially when replacing protein from livestock sources — with the greatest reductions seen in land use and GWP compared to other protein-rich food and feed sources. The amount of land needed to produce MP and Tr-OVA was 0.1-1.3% of the land required for beef herds. Even by comparison to peas, which generally require little land compared to other animal and plant-based protein sources, land use requirements were 73-97% less. Both MP and Tr-OVA production also led to reductions in GWP when compared to other protein-rich foods, especially by comparison to animal-based protein sources. However, agricultural protein alternatives with a lower GWP were also identified, such as peas, rapeseed cake and soybean meal. Differences in the impacts of MP and Tr-OVA production were mostly explained by the reliance of Tr-OVA on agricultural inputs. Depending on the impact category, up to 94% of the environmental impacts of Tr-OVA production were related to its use of agriculturally sourced glucose. For MP, environmental impacts were mainly caused by the use of electricity; up to 90% depending on the category. For Tr-OVA, the impacts caused by the use of electricity were between 0% and 56%. The results for shrimp clearly indicated the importance of the inclusion of LULUC emissions from mangrove deforestation, as GHG emissions were 14-60 times higher for shrimp farming systems located in former mangrove areas than for systems that were not. The GHG emissions of shrimp produced in mangrove areas far outweighed the GWP of other protein-rich food sources and were 4.5 times higher than that of beef production from beef herds. Despite the great potential of cellular agriculture products to reduce the environmental impacts of protein production, minor trade-offs were found. For example, the potential for ozone depletion and water scarcity were higher for Tr-OVA in comparison to other feed protein alternatives. The environmental impacts of cellular agricultural products could be further reduced by using renewable or low-carbon energy sources. However, the electricity requirements for cellular agricultural products are higher than those of agriculture and aquaculture. As many sectors are looking to move away from fossil fuels towards low-carbon electricity sources, potential greater demand for electricity from the food sector will add further pressure to increase sustainable electricity production capacity. The work in this dissertation focused solely on the environmental impacts of food production. Additional research is needed into the role of cell-cultured food within a sustainable food system. This means that the research begun in this dissertation should be expanded to include other environmental impact categories such as biodiversity impacts, and the loss of ecosystem services. Additionally, there is a need to increase understanding of the social and economic implications of the introduction of cell-cultured foods, such as MP and Tr-OVA, into the food systems in different regions of the world.",environmental sciences,"Cultivated Meat Library,PISCES/ATLAS",,,,,,2022,,,,,Helsingin yliopisto,2022-11-08,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,9789515173461,,,,,,2023-01-12,2023-01-13

This work captures investor and key informant perspectives primarily from North America about cellular agriculture by utilizing thematic analysis from qualitative interview data. Findings highlight the role and perspectives of strategic capital as a necessary mechanism to fund bringing cellular meat technologies to the marketplace. The data also indicated that cellular agriculture products would likely complement existing meat products like plant-based meats and that massive infrastructure is required to produce these products at scale. In addition, respondents posited that higher income, urban and politically liberal consumers would likely be early adopters of cellular meat products and that a significant challenge will be providing availability to the wider less affluent population.",,Cultivated Meat Library,CC BY,,,,,2022,,,1-22,International Food and Agribusiness Management Review,Wageningen Academic Publishers,2022-09-27,,,,10.22434/IFAMR2022.0017,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023-01-12,2023-01-13

Much of the interest in cellular agriculture stems from its potential as a way of producing high-quality proteins and other nutrients with reduced environmental impact. Cellular agriculture techniques are rapidly nearing commercial scales of production, in part due to the application of knowledge and techniques produced through genomics research related to gene expression, editing, and genome-scale data analytics. However, much remains unknown and there is little rigorous evidence to test these assertions. This chapter applies the UN Sustainable Development Goals as a lens through which to examine protein production using cellular agriculture, to understand how it may contribute to the development of more sustainable and resilient food system. We examine two emerging approaches to cellular agriculture—cultured meat and fermentation-derived dairy—and explore both the complexity and knowledge gaps that need to be filled to ensure these tools are deployed to help create a more sustainable future for all.

As such, there is substantial interest in finding albumin alternatives which are low-cost, effective, scalable, sustainable, and suitable for food applications. Recently, a serum-free medium termed Beefy-9 was developed for bovine satellite cells (BSCs), which relied on recombinant albumin as a key component to replace fetal bovine serum. Here we alter Beefy-9 by replacing albumin with rapeseed protein isolate, a bulk-protein solution obtained from agricultural waste-streams through simple isoelectric protein precipitation. This new medium, termed Beefy-R, improves BSC growth compared with Beefy-9 while maintaining cell phenotype and myogenicity.

The perceptions of youth, as a specific consumer cohort, have not been reported to date despite young adults having more flexible dietary habits and being more likely to avoid red meat because of animal welfare and environmental concerns. Thus, youth represent a demographic that may be more accepting of CM and for whom the pro-environmental consequences of early adoption may be realized across an entire lifespan. In this study of college-aged Canadians (mean = 20 years), we examined perceptions of CM (mixed methods) and assessed the effects of educational messaging about its benefits and then naturalness framing on intention to consume it (within subjects quantitative experimental design). Results show that youth believe CM to be unnatural, ethical, and environmentally friendly, and that taste is an important element of acceptance. Linear regression showed that food disgust was a significant predictor for both intent to incorporate CM into regular diet and completely replace meat/meat substitutes with CM. In both instances, increasing food disgust was associated with lower behavioral intent. Environmental values were also a predictor for completely replacing meat/meat substitutes with CM, where it positively affected intent and showed a similar effect size to food disgust. Both messaging on the benefits of CM and naturalness framing increased intent to consume it across all three measures and by a similar magnitude [p (F) < 0.05].

This study examined differences in ethical risk perception using online survey data gathered in 2020. An ordered logit technique yielded the probabilities of changes in ethical risk perception influenced by demographic attributes, views about the technology, and adequacy of industry regulations. The results show that consumers associated PM with low ethical risk. Educated consumers were more likely to agree that the ethical risks of CM are higher than PM and to regard PM products as safer than CM. Price sensitivity made consumers more likely to agree that the ethical risks related to CM are higher than those related to PM. Ingredient safety concerns increased the ethical risk perception of CM. Consumers perceiving the meat substitute classification to be unclear were more likely to assign a higher ethical risk to CM than PM. The perception of ethical risk associated with CM was greater than that associated with PM if meat substitute industry regulations were inadequate.

This study analyzes literature reports to contextualize CM's protein and calorie use efficiencies, comparing CM to animal meat products' feed conversion ratios, areal productivities, and nitrogen management. Our analyses show that CM has greater protein and energy areal productivities than conventional meat products, and that waste nitrogen from spent media is critical to CM surpassing the nitrogen use efficiency of meat produced in swine and broiler land-applied manure systems. The CM nutrient management costs, arising from wastewater treatment and land application, are estimated to be more expensive than in conventional meat production.

The interviews and workshops aimed to identify the key safety questions and priority areas of research. Participants raised questions about which aspects of cultured meat and seafood production are novel, and the implications of the paucity of public information on the topic. Novel parameters and targets may require the development of new analytical methods or adaptation and validation of existing ones, including for a diversity of product types and processes. Participants emphasized that data sharing of these efforts would be valuable, similar to those already developed and used in the food and pharmaceutical fields. Contributions to such databases from the private and public sectors would speed general understanding as well as efforts to make evaluations more efficient. In turn, these resources, combined with transparent risk assessment, will be critical elements of building consumer trust in cultured meat and seafood products.",,Cultivated Meat Library,CC BY,,,,,2023,,,,,,2023-04-18,,,,10.20944/preprints202304.0475.v1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Preprints.org,2023-04-28,2023-05-05

Cultivated meat utilizes cell culture and tissue engineering technologies to culture a vast number of cells in vitro and grow/assemble them into structures mimicking the muscle tissues of livestock animals. Stem cells with self-renewal and lineage-specific differentiation abilities have been considered one of the key cell sources for cultivated meats. However, the extensive in vitro culturing/expansion of stem cells results in a reduction in their abilities to proliferate and differentiate. Extracellular matrix (ECM) has been used as a culturing substrate to support cell expansion for cell-based therapies in regenerative medicine due to its resemblance to the native microenvironment of cells. In this study, the effect of the ECM on the expansion of bovine umbilical cord stromal cells (BUSC) in vitro was evaluated and characterized. BUSCs with multi-lineage differentiation potentials were isolated from bovine placental tissue. Decellularized ECM prepared from a confluent monolayer of bovine fibroblasts (BF) is free of cellular components but contains major ECM proteins such as fibronectin and type I collagen and ECM-associated growth factors. Expansion of BUSC on ECM for three passages (around three weeks) resulted in about 500-fold amplification, while cells were amplified less than 10-fold when cultured on standard tissue culture plates (TCP). Moreover, the presence of ECM reduced the requirement for serum in the culture medium. Importantly, the cells amplified on ECM retained their differentiation abilities better than cells cultured on TCP. The results of our study support the notion that monolayer cell-derived ECM may be a strategy to expand bovine cells in vitro effectively and efficiently.",,Cultivated Meat Library,CC BY,,,Bos taurus,,2023,14,4,218,J.

A muscle phenotype was confirmed through characterization of muscle stemness and differentiation via paired-box protein 7 and myosin heavy chain immunostaining, respectively. An adipocyte-like phenotype was also demonstrated for the cells through lipid accumulation, confirmed via Oil Red O staining and quantification of neutral lipids. New qPCR primers (HPRT, PAX3B, MYOD1, MYOG, TNNT3A, and PPARG) were tailored to the mackerel genome and used to characterize mackerel cell genotypes.

However, the use of FBS has associated ethical, biosafety, and cost concerns in industrial cell culture and limits application in cultivated meat production. Okara is an agro-waste generated in huge abundance daily, which can be biotransformed by fermentation. Different fractions of the fermented okara extracts were prepared by ultrafiltration according to their molecular weight and termed as unfractionated, 50 kDa, 10 kDa, and 3 kDa. Our results from the MTT assay showed that the 50 kDa fractionated fermented okara extract at 1 mg/mL was the most effective serum replacement under daily replenishment of media, as the viability of both HEK293 and HepG2 cells achieved a relative growth efficiency (RGE) of 70% compared to that of the positive control where traditional FBS was used (RGE was 100%). To understand the mechanism behind this, the metabolite profiles of 24 and 72 h HEK293 and HepG2 spent cell culture media were taken for analysis using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. To explore the potential of using fermented okara extracts in cultivated meat production, the extracts were added to C2C12 and immortalized porcine myoblast cultures where growth was observed over 72 and 48 h, respectively.

These products include cultivated and plant-based meat, as well as those derived through fermentation processes. Proponents of alternative proteins claim that they offer opportunities to tackle multiple socio-environmental challenges. However, their development also presents many challenges, which require careful analysis. To this end, this paper addresses the research question: To what extent can the socio-technical transitions literature explain the current state and future potential of plant-based meat and cultivated meat products, including the impacts and challenges associated with these emerging technologies? This paper reviews the literature on alternative proteins from a socio-technical transitions perspective applying the Multi Level Perspective and the Strategic Niche Management approaches, and identifies a research agenda of knowledge gaps and research questions. The review is focused on the United States due to its central role in the development of these technologies. The agenda identifies key questions that can be asked of alternative proteins using a socio-technical transitions framework, and maps them to the niche level, the niche-regime interactions level, and to the heuristic dynamics of the Multi Level Perspective. The findings suggest that meeting the full potential of these technologies requires public investment and long term planning, open access research, more strategic funding, efforts to advance regulation and social legitimacy, innovation in business models, and learning from social movements, other industries, and the visions of fringe stakeholders. This paper demonstrates that examining the scaling and trajectory of alternative proteins from a socio-technical sustainability transitions perspective could offer useful and important lessons and insights into the current and future role of these technologies.",Cultivated meat; Cultured meat; Plant-based products; Sustainability transitions; Strategic niche management; Multi level perspective; Sustainable food systems,Cultivated Meat Library,CC BY-NC-ND,,,,,2023,405,,136999,J.

CM, also known as cultured, cell-based, lab-grown, in vitro or clean meat, is obtained through cellular agriculture, which is based on applying tissue engineering principles. In practice, it is first necessary to choose the best cell source and type, and then to furnish the necessary nutrients, growth factors and signalling molecules via cultivation media. This procedure occurs in a controlled environment that provides the surfaces necessary for anchor-dependent cells and offers microcarriers and scaffolds that favour the three-dimensional (3D) organisation of multiple cell types.

Simultaneously, efforts are being undertaken to strengthen the scaffolding to improve cell proliferation, differentiation, and tissue formation. Muscle cells proliferate and differentiate according to the directional patterns of the scaffold, similar to natural tissue and native muscle tissue. Therefore, establishing an aligned pattern in the scaffolding architecture is vital for cultured meat applications. Recent studies on the fabrication of scaffolds with aligned porosity structures and their utility in manufacturing cultured meat are highlighted in this review. In addition, the directional growth of muscle cells in terms of proliferation and differentiation has also been explored, along with the aligned scaffolding architectures. The aligned porosity architecture of the scaffolds supports the texture and quality of meat-like structures. Although it is difficult to build adequate scaffolds for culturing meat manufactured from diverse biopolymers, it is necessary to develop novel methods to create aligned scaffolding structures. Furthermore, to avoid animal slaughter in the future, it will be imperative to adopt non-animal-based biomaterials, growth factors, and serum-free media conditions for quality meat production.",Scaffolds; aligned porous structures; directional muscle cell growth; cultured meat,Cultivated Meat Library,Not CC-licensed,,,,,2023,168,112755,112755,Food Res.

As the available evaluation tools have imprecise wording and fall short of providing critical information, this study endeavoured to develop a neophobia scale that captured product-specific nuances of cultured meat. The developed scale was tested using data collected in South Africa. Factor and correlation analyses were conducted to determine the dominant consumer concerns and the groups in society that would face the greatest psychological hinderances to adopting of cultured meat. The study's findings show generally low neophobia in the South African market. Negative sentiment was dominated by meat quality concerns while health, food safety, social and cultural concerns, which normally form stronger objections to food acceptance, were low. The study predicts that market penetration would be hardest among older consumers, due to their relatively higher neophobia. However, if marketing efforts are targeted at addressing consumers’ social concerns, marginal increases in acceptance may be experienced among meat-eaters, people reducing their meat consumption, household heads and consumers from high-income provinces. The study concludes that collaboration between the public and private sectors in the provision of legislation guiding food safety and the setting of quality standards will be key to addressing consumer concerns in the evolving protein supply market.",Consumer acceptance; food marketing; meat quality; social and cultural concerns,Cultivated Meat Library,CC BY-NC-ND,,,,,2023,20,,e01641,Scientific African,,2023-07-01,,2468-2276,,10.1016/j.sciaf.2023.e01641,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023-04-28,2023-05-05

However, while most of the published studies on cell-cultured meat have only focused on muscle tissue culture, fat production which is an important component of the process, was often neglected from this technology, despite the fact that it can enhance the meat final taste, aroma, tenderness, texture, and palatability. In this study, we particularly added data on the bovine muscle part reconstruction by monitoring and optimizing the possible expansion rate of isolated primary bovine adipose stem cells and their adipogenesis differentiation in a fully edible way for cultured meat application. From the data, after around 100 days of serial passages, the isolated bovine adipose derived stem cells doubled 57 ± 5 times in the edible cell culture medium condition. It means that from around 10 g of fat muscle tissue, at least 2.9x1022 cells can be obtained by culturing and amplifying them. Their adipogenesis differentiation ability was then found possible up to at least 12 passages and the final lipid composition has been controlled by adjusting the fatty acids composition of the culture medium during the differentiation, up to reaching organoleptic features similar to real fat muscle composition, especially the cis isomer oleic acid percentage, an important part of the specific high-grade Japanese Wagyu meat. These characteristics of the primary bovine adipose derived stem cells proliferation and adipogenesis differentiation provide valuable insights into the production of meat alternatives in vitro.",,Cultivated Meat Library,CC BY,,,Bos taurus,,2023,,,,,,2023-03-16,,,,10.21203/rs.3.rs-2523494/v1,,,,"Osaka University, Osaka, Japan; Osaka University; Institute of Industrial Science; Nissin Foods Holdings Co., Ltd; Department of Mechano-Informatics, Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, The University of Tokyo",,,,,,,,,,,Research Square,2023-04-28,2023-05-05

Given that current diets need to change significantly, novel/future foods (e.g., insect meal, cultured meat, microalgae, mycoprotein) present options for protein alternatives in future diets with lower total environmental impacts than animal source foods. Comparisons at the more concrete meal level would help consumers better understand the scale of environmental impacts of single meals and substitutability of animal sourced foods with novel foods. Our aim was to compare the environmental impacts of meals including novel/future foods with those of vegan and omnivore meals. We compiled a database on environmental impacts and nutrient composition of novel/future foods and modeled the impacts of calorically similar meals. Additionally, we applied two nutritional Life Cycle Assessment (nLCA) methods to compare the meals in terms of nutritional content and environmental impacts in one index. All meals with novel/future foods had up to 88 % less Global Warming Potential, 83 % less land use, 87 % less scarcity-weighted water use, 95 % less freshwater eutrophication, 78 % less marine eutrophication, and 92 % less terrestrial acidification impacts than similar meals with animal source foods, while still offering the same nutritional value as vegan and omnivore meals. The nLCA indices of most novel/future food meals are similar to protein-rich plant-based alternative meals and show fewer environmental impacts in terms of nutrient richness than most animal source meals. Substituting animal source foods with certain novel/future foods may provide for nutritious meals with substantial environmental benefits for sustainably transforming future food systems.",Acidification; Alternative proteins; Environmental impacts; Eutrophication; Global Warming Potential; Land/water use; Novel foods; Sustainable meals,Cultivated Meat Library,CC BY,,,,,2023,876,,162796,Sci.

Autophagy is an important mechanism for senescent cells to remove toxic substances. However, the role of autophagy in the replicative senescence of MSCs is controversial. Here, we evaluated the changes in autophagy in porcine MSCs (pMSCs) during long-term culture in vitro and identified a natural phytochemical, ginsenoside Rg2, that could stimulate pMSC proliferation. First, some typical senescence characteristics were observed in aged pMSCs, including decreased EdU-positive cells, increased senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity, declined stemness-associated marker OCT4 expression, and enhanced P53 expression. Importantly, autophagic flux was impaired in aged pMSCs, suggesting deficient substrate clearance in aged pMSCs. Rg2 was found to promote the proliferation of pMSCs using MTT assay and EdU staining. In addition, Rg2 inhibited D-galactose-induced senescence and oxidative stress in pMSCs. Rg2 increased autophagic activity via the AMPK signaling pathway. Furthermore, long-term culture with Rg2 promoted the proliferation, inhibited the replicative senescence, and maintained the stemness of pMSCs.

Limited research specific to Aotearoa New Zealand (A-NZ) is available. Survey responses from 592 A-NZ residents were analysed to determine CM awareness, willingness to engage with CM, and perceived CM product attributes relative to conventional meat and plant-based meat alternatives (PBMAs). The effects of gender, age, meat/PBMA consumption frequency, CM awareness, and food neophobia on CM perceptions were determined. The statements were rated on a seven-point Likert scale. Half (52%) of the respondents agreed they were aware of CM. The awareness was higher in men compared to women (p = 0.036), higher in Millennials compared to Generation X (p = 0.022), and higher in regular compared to infrequent PBMA consumers (p = 0.0003). The willingness to engage with CM and perceived CM product attributes were consistently more positive in consumers who were aware, compared with consumers not aware of CM (p < 0.05). Being male, Millennial, low neophobic and a low meat, or high PBMA consumer was also associated with higher potential engagement and perceptions of CM to varying extents. Segmentation divided the respondents into three groups. The ‘positive’ cluster (41%) consumed more PBMAs and less meat and was more aware of CM than the ‘neutral’ (50%) and ‘negative’ (9%) clusters. In conclusion, consumers in A-NZ are not a homogenous group with regards to their perceptions and potential engagement with CM.

One viable way to address such climate impact is to make people become more aware of more sustainable diet options, such as cultivated meat. However, it is challenging to instigate change in people's meat-eating habit, and empirical works have been examining the psychological factors that are related to consumers' willingness to consume cultivated meat. Research has suggested that psychological well-being can play a role in the meaning-making of food consumption, with higher well-being individuals showing more recognition of other sociocultural benefits of consuming food beyond just fulfilling their sustenance needs. As existing works have yet to understand the link between well-being and consumption of novel foods, the current research set out to fill this gap by examining the relationship between people's psychological well-being and their willingness to consume cultivated meat via different reasons (mediators) for consuming cultivated meat. We recruited a representative sample of 948 adults in Singapore to complete an online survey. The study offered the first evidence that there is a positive relationship between people's psychological well-being and their willingness to consume cultivated meat. Further, results revealed that their higher willingness can be motivated by the perception that cultivated meat is as healthy and nutritious, as safe as, and has the same sensory quality as real meat, and is beneficial to the society. This investigation adds to the growing literature on consumer acceptance of cultivated meat by showing the novel finding that well-being and receptivity to cultivated meat is positively linked, and such a positive link can be explained by people's better recognition of the prospective benefits offered by this alternative food.",Climate change; Consumer acceptance; Cultivated meat; Psychological well-being,Cultivated Meat Library,Not CC-licensed,,,,,2023,184,,106496,Appetite,,2023-05-01,,0195-6663,1095-8304,10.1016/j.appet.2023.106496,36828077,,,"Singapore Management University, Singapore.

UV-vis spectroscopy and contact angle measurements confirmed the annatto extract incorporation into the CA nanofibers and the surface wettability of both scaffolds, respectively.

Compared with the pure CA nanofibers, CA@A nanofibers showed increased fiber diameter (420 ± 212 nm vs. 284 ± 130 nm).

Sample selection was based on language, that is, English and Japanese. Further selection was exploratory to analyze the diverse degree of the integration of cell-based meats in policies. The region and countries were selected as leading cases, thereby enabling a policy comparison because they host global corporations that produce cell-based meat. The literature review examined peer-reviewed social science articles from 2013 to early 2022 on policies that promote cell-based meats. The results of the policy surveys revealed that regulations focused on the safety of and measures to display these novel foods by conducting a premarket assessment. These regulations are the basis for developing cell-based meats. Furthermore, some countries and the region being studied justified their support for cell-based meats by implementing action plans for decarbonization and food security. However, unclear communication regarding the nomenclature of cell-based meats is likely to slow down the development of cell-based meats. Moreover, religious beliefs and other cultural perceptions, including animal welfare, leave much room to research such promotion.

Therefore, in this study, we aim to establish a method to reproduce the macroscopic morphology of skeletal muscle by constructing an engineered muscle tissue (EMT) by culturing embryonic chicken myoblast-like cells that are unidirectionally aligned in collagen hydrogels with micro-channels (i.e., MCCG). Whole mount fluorescent imaging of the EMT showed that the myotubes were unidirectionally aligned and that they were bundled in the collagen gel matrix. The myotubes contracted in response to periodic electrostimulations with a frequency range of 0.5-2.0 Hz, but not at 5.0 Hz. Compression tests of the EMT showed that the EMT had anisotropic elasticity. In addition, by measuring the relaxation moduli of the EMTs, an anisotropy of relaxation strengths was observed. The observed anisotropies could be attributed to differences in maturation and connectivity of myotubes in the directions perpendicular and parallel to the long axis of the micro-channels of the MCCG.",collagen hydrogels; engineered muscle tissue; tissue engineering; viscoelasticity,Cultivated Meat Library,CC BY,,,Gallus gallus,,2023,9,2,141,Gels,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,2023-02-08,,2310-2861,2310-2861,10.3390/gels9020141,36826311,PMC9956229,,"Department of Applied Chemistry and Food Science, Faculty of Environmental and Information Science, Fukui University of Technology, Fukui 910-8505, Japan.",en,,,,,,,,,,,2023-04-28,2023-05-05

The authors selected 86 articles that were coded using NVivo 12 software according to the theoretical framework chosen for this study: (1) consumer attitude ambivalence (benefit–risk) – conflicting presence of positive and negative attitudes in decision-making, (2) the consumer preference theory – choice of consumers based on utility maximisation or best characteristics/determinants and (3) the three-dimensional perspective of attitude – cognitive, affective and behavioural components. The authors followed the methodological steps (formulation of the research question, identification of relevant scientific studies, evaluation of the quality of studies, summary of evidence and interpretation of results) recommended by Lipsey and Wilson (2001) and Tranfield et al. (2003). Several keywords were drawn from a study by Bryant and Barnett (2019) on cultured meat (CM) nomenclature and its impact on consumer acceptance.Findings The identified articles were relatively recent (84/86 articles were published after 2010) and in the fields of agriculture and ethical agriculture (22/86), policy and regulations (12/86) and psychology (11/86). Content analysis helped identify four types of ambivalent determinants for the adoption of cultured meat: ethics, intrinsic, informational and belief. The results suggest the existence of a group of “dominant” determinants for each attitude component. Thus, the dominant determinants of cognitive, affective and conative components are informational, ethical and intrinsic determinants, respectively.Research limitations/implications This research is based on a systematic review of literature and is a review of the narrative literature that provides an overview of what is known about cultured meat adoption. The main weakness of this type of method is the feasibility generally associated with the existence (and a sufficient number) of studies that can be included. Other types of the meta-analytic method could have been used and could have explored different measures and biases (e.g. effect sizes, statistical power, sampling error, measurement error and publication bias). Also, as a food technology whose social acceptability would be influenced by all stakeholders, it would be relevant to expand the analysis to other types of stakeholders.Practical implications Little is still known to the public about the adoption mechanisms of this technology. In terms of behaviour, Siegrist et al. (2018) suggest that new studies should focus on factors that influence the individual differences in the willingness of consumers to eat or purchase cultured meat. By identifying the dominant target influence of informational determinants on cognitive components, that of ethical determinants on affective components and finally that of intrinsic determinants on conative attitudes, this article offers a first avenue of solution to businesses operating in this new industry, as well as to public authorities, to improve the acceptance of cultured meat. Private businesses will benefit from the results of this research by understanding the underlying motivations of consumers to adopt this type of innovation in order to adjust future marketing.Social implications This article, through better understanding of the psychological mechanisms that contribute to its social acceptability amongst the population, has the potential to improve educational campaigns for this technology. The results could thus guide both public policies as well as the regulation of activities related to cultured meat in the coming years, professional orders, private businesses and the general public. It thus provides initial insight needed to understand this public debate.Originality/value Research addressing cultured meat has come primarily from agribusiness and environmental and biological sciences. The authors highlighted the need for interdisciplinary collaboration between biological and social sciences to address ethical issues.

In an effort to make healthy food choices, consumers often flock to food products that boast “organic,” “all-natural,” or “non-GMO” labels. But are all of these foods really better? In this note, I discuss the confusion surrounding “natural” food and how it has hindered progress toward more productive and sustainable food systems. First, I examine the hazy definition of “natural” foods and explain why consumers continue to demand natural foods despite their environmental impacts. Second, I discuss how consumers’ single-minded focus on natural foods has stymied scientific research and invited apathy toward unsustainable agricultural practices but has also emphasized how some new technologies may present an opportunity to improve food science literacy among consumers moving forward. Third, I outline one past attempt to legislate consumers’ fears of artificial foods (the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990) and discusses that law’s strengths and flaws. And fourth, I argue that focusing the conversation squarely on food system sustainability— and in the process, giving the word “sustainable” some legal heft—will not only force a reexamination of our broken “natural” foods narrative but will also direct our collective attention toward the current climate crisis.",,Cultivated Meat Library,Not CC-licensed,,,,,2023,29,1,81,Hastings Environmental Law Journal,,2023,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023-04-28,2023-05-05

This process requires significant amounts of culture medium, which accounts to a major portion of the production cost. Furthermore, it is composed of nutrients derived from grains and heterotrophic microorganisms and fetal bovine serum (FBS), which will impact the sustainability of cultured meat in future. Here, we developed a novel medium containing nutrients extracted from microalga and cell-secreted growth factors. First, rat liver epithelial RL34 cells were cultured by adding Chlorella vulgaris extract (CVE) to inorganic salt solution. The supernatant, containing the RL34 cell-secreted growth factors, was used as the conditioned medium (CM). This CM, with CVE added as a nutrient source, was applied to primary bovine myoblast cultures. This serum-free and grain-derived-nutrient-free medium promoted the proliferation of bovine myoblasts, the main cell source for cultured beef.

Japan has a tradition of entomophagy, and a startup private company was highlighted in mass media. In Singapore, although the country is one of the leading countries producing novel foods, entomophagy itself is not popular; this is because major religions in Singapore do not recommend or prohibit eating insects. For the government policy, the specific standards of entomophagy and cultured meat are still in development in Japan and other majority of countries.

As population of human increases, the demand for meat also keeps increasing. Therefore, a new alternative is introduced by inventing a cultured meat obtained from the outer side of the animal's body and became the rumours in the 1930s. In spite of that, the idea of cultured meat invention was only realized in 2013 by a Dutch scientist which was invented a burger-shaped cultured beef. However, this invention did not exist in the time of the Prophet, his companions and the tābi'īn and it becomes a polemic among the Muslim community regarding of its halal status nowadays. The existence of cultured meat in the current society needs a clear explanation and procedure in fiqh because it is one of the new discoveries in food industry.

Fish cell lines from Actinopterygii (ray-finned fishes) are used to illustrate this distinction and to demonstrate how these properties can be used in various ways to categorize cell lines into groups or invitromes. Before-the-fact properties are set at initiation and are properties of the sample and species from which the cell line arose and of the scientist(s) who developed the cell line. On the basis of the Actinopterygii sample, invitromes exist for embryos, larvae, juveniles, adults, and spawning fish, and for most solid organs but rarely for biological fluids. For species, invitromes exist for only a small fraction of the Actinopterygii total. As to their development, scientists from around the world have contributed to invitromes. By contrast, after-the-fact properties are limitless and become apparent during development, characterization, use, and storage of the cell line. For ray-finned invitromes, cell lines appear to acquire immortality during development, are characterized poorly for differentiation potential, have numerous uses, and are stored formally only sporadically. As an example of applying these principles to a specific organ, the skeletal muscle invitrome is used. For ante factum properties, the cell lines are mainly from trunk muscle of economically important fish from 11 orders, 15 families, 19 genera, and 21 species of ray-finned fishes. For post factum properties, fibroblast-like and myogenic cell lines have been described but epithelial-like FHM is most widely used and curated. Considering cell lines by their before- and after-the-fact properties should facilitate integration of new cell lines into the literature and help incorporate the discipline of cell biology into other research areas, particularly the natural history of fishes.",Actinopterygii; Cell lines; Fish; Immortal; Invitromes; Myogenesis; Natural history; Omics; Skeletal muscle,"Cultivated Meat Library,PISCES/ATLAS",Not CC-licensed,,,Actinopterygii,,2023,59,1,41-62,In Vitro Cell.

This kind of meat does not derive from animal or vegetal cultures but is produced on the basis of “tissue-engineering” technologies, by injecting muscle tissue from an animal into a cell culture, allowing cells to “grow” outside the animal's body. By considering the similar nutritional characteristics of traditional types of meat, and the potential in terms of sustainability, the authors investigate the effect of the advertising, communication focus promoting LGM-based meat, on consumers' willingness to buy (WTB) and word-of-mouth (WOM), by shedding light on the moderator role of consumers' environmentalism and status consumption orientation tendency in influencing such relationship.Design/methodology/approach Through an exploratory research design, the authors conducted a study based on a two-cell experiment that manipulated the advertising communication focus by using a hamburger made of synthetic meat related to a fictitious brand called “Gnam”, to manipulate the advertising communication focus (sustainability vs. taste), then evaluating consumers' WTB, WOM, environmentalism and status consumption orientation.Findings Results show that the communication focus (sustainability vs. taste) exerts a positive effect on consumers' WTB and WOM, and how such effect is magnified both by consumers' environmentalism and status consumption orientation, in the attempt to show other a green status and their green consumption tendency.Research limitations/implications Despite the promising results, the study does not consider other consumers' individual differences, i.e. as for the role of age, or cultural differences.Practical implications Practically, this study suggests marketers and managers how to design effective marketing campaigns to incentivise LGM-based food products purchase, and promote positive WOM, on the basis of certain consumers' individual differences useful to segment their clientele in terms of environmentalism, and status consumption orientation tendency.Social implications Socially, this study may contribute to incentivising the use of alternative forms of meat as a food product not deriving from animal or vegetal culture, coherently with recent sustainability worldwide claimed goals.Originality/value This is the first paper to investigate consumers' reactions to LGM-based food products, by shedding light on the fundamental role of consumers' individual differences.",,Cultivated Meat Library,Not CC-licensed,,,,,2023,ahead-of-print,ahead-of-print,,British Food Journal,,2023-01-01,,0007-070X,,10.1108/BFJ-09-2022-0751,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023-04-28,2023-05-05

However, few studies have explored the key factors driving and inhibiting willingness to try, buy and pay a price premium for plant-based proteins, fungal-based proteins and cultured muscle tissue. Therefore, the present study is dedicated to this research gap and proposes a model that combines driving and inhibiting factors such as food neophobia, food technology neophobia, the environmental and specific benefits of alternative meat products as well as intrinsic attributes of meat such as taste, texture and smell. Partial least squares structural equation modeling shows that the largest drivers of consumer willingness to consume meat substitute are their perceived suitability (specific benefits) and environmental impact. Conversely, the biggest inhibitors to consumption were the nutritional importance of meat, the importance of meat taste, texture, and smell, and food neophobia and food technology neophobia. How the drivers and inhibitors varied between plant-based, fungal-based, and cultured muscle tissue are discussed and implications for industry leaders and future research are discussed.",,Cultivated Meat Library,Not CC-licensed,,,,,2023,,,1-25,Journal of International Food & Agribusiness Marketing,Routledge,2023-01-23,,0897-4438,,10.1080/08974438.2023.2169428,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023-04-28,2023-05-05

Yet, less is known about methods that can reduce the natural-is-better bias. The objective of the present research is to see whether intellectual humility, a moral virtue that can be understood as a more open and curious mindset, reduces naturalness bias in terms of drug-related decisions. METHODS: We tested our hypotheses across four studies using different populations (university students and community adults) and methods (correlational and experimental). Study 1 involved a survey exploring whether university students choosing a synthetic drug tended to display a higher level of intellectual humility than those choosing a natural drug. Study 2 assessed the link using observation of real-world behavior in non-student adults. Study 3 adopted an experimental approach to test the idea that reflecting on one's intellectual fallibility can at least temporarily reduce naturalness bias on drug choice. Study 4 examined the potential mediating mechanism underlying the observed effect. RESULTS: We found correlational and experimental evidence that participants higher in intellectual humility were more likely to choose the synthetic drug than those lower in intellectual humility in both self-report and behavioral measures. The results also demonstrate that openness to experience mediated the effect of intellectual humility on naturalness bias. CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight intellectual humility as a malleable, psychological variable that can combat biased thinking associated with health-related decision-making.",Drug choice; Health behavior; Intellectual humility; Natural; Naturalness bias; Synthetic,Cultivated Meat Library,Not CC-licensed,,,,,2023,317,,115625,Soc.

Typically, 5-10% by volume of fetal bovine serum (FBS) is used, which accounts for a vast majority of the media cost while also imposing environmental and ethical concerns associated with the use of animal serum. Here we tested the efficacy of culturing cells by replacing serum in the media with algae extract and select additives. Using LC-MS, we compared molecular signatures of FBS to Chlorella algae extracts and identified NAD(H)/NADP(H) as common and relatively abundant features in their characteristic profiles. Bovine fibroblasts, cultured in serum-free media supplemented with C. vulgaris extract and just two growth factors plus insulin, showed significant growth with enhanced viability compared to control cells cultured without serum, albeit still lower than that of controls cultured with 10% FBS. Moreover, C. vulgaris extract enhanced cell viability beyond that of cells cultured with the two growth factors and insulin alone. These results suggest that key components in serum which are essential for cell growth may also be present in C. vulgaris extract, demonstrating that it may be used at least as a partial alternative to serum for cell culture applications.",Algae extract; Bovine fibroblast; Cell-cultured meat; Serum replacement; Serum-free media,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2023,23,1,4,BMC Biotechnol.,,2023-02-08,,1472-6750,,10.1186/s12896-023-00774-w,36755248,PMC9909908,,"Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Colorado College, Colorado Springs, CO, USA.

Here, guided by reports showing that hPSCs can self-organize in vitro into cysts reminiscent of the epiblast stage in embryo development, we developed a physio-mimetic approach for hPSC culture. We engineered stem cell niche microenvironments inside microfluidics-assisted core-shell microcapsules. We demonstrate that lumenized three-dimensional colonies significantly improve viability and expansion rates while maintaining pluripotency compared to standard hPSC culture platforms such as 2D cultures, microcarriers, and aggregates. By further tuning capsule size and culture conditions, we scale up this method to industrial-scale stirred tank bioreactors and achieve an unprecedented hPSC amplification rate of 277-fold in 6.5 days. In brief, our findings indicate that our 3D culture system offers a suitable strategy both for basic stem cell biology experiments and for clinical applications.",3D culture; Biomicrofluidics; Cell expansion; Human induced pluripotent stem cells; Stem cell niche,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2023,295,,122033,Biomaterials,,2023-04,,0142-9612,1878-5905,10.1016/j.biomaterials.2023.122033,36764194,,,"Université Paris Cité, Imagine Institute, IPSC Core Facility, INSERM UMR U1163, F-75015, Paris, France; Treefrog Therapeutics, F-33600, Pessac, France.

Cultured animal cells are grown in large bioreactors under controlled nutrient, growth factor, and environmental conditions. The cells used are taken from cows, pigs, chickens, and fish, without having to kill any animals, thereby reducing many of the negative impacts of using animals for food. Meat alternatives can also be grown from microbial cells (such as microfungi or bacteria) in bioreactors. The mycoprotein known as Quorn is a successful example of this technology. Recently, some companies have used this approach to create meat analogs from air and sunlight, which use microbes to create proteins from the carbon dioxide and water in air powdered by solar energy. The utilization of precision fermentation to produce milk, egg, or meat proteins that have never been inside an animal is also highlighted, as well as the application of this technology to produce other ingredients useful for application in meat analogs, such as flavors, colors, and preservatives. The potential of these new technologies to compete with the meat industry is highlighted.",,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2023,,,149-183,,Springer Nature Switzerland,2023,,,,10.1007/978-3-031-23961-8_7,,,,,,McClements DJ,,,Meat Less: The Next Food Revolution,9783031239618,,,,,,2023-04-28,2023-05-05

A key challenge facing this goal is the high-cost of recombinant albumin which is necessary in many serum-free media formulations, including a recently developed serum-free medium for bovine satellite cell (BSC) culture termed Beefy-9. Here we alter Beefy-9 by replacing recombinant albumin with rapeseed protein isolate (RPI), a bulk-protein solution obtained from agricultural waste through alkali extraction (pH 12.5), isoelectric protein precipitation (pH 4.5), dissolution of physiologically soluble proteins (pH 7.2), and concentration of proteins through 3 kDa ultrafiltration. This new medium, termed Beefy-R, was then used to culture BSCs over four passages, during which cells grew with an average doubling time of 26.6 h, showing improved growth compared with Beefy-9. In Beefy-R, BSCs maintained cell phenotype and myogenicity. Together, these results offer an effective, low-cost, and sustainable alternative to albumin for serum-free culture of muscle stem cells, thereby addressing a key hurdle facing cultured meat production.",Cellular agriculture; Cultured meat; Muscle satellite cells; Plant protein isolates; Serum-free media,"Cultivated Meat Library,Cultivated Meat 101",,,,,,2023,296,,122092,Biomaterials,,2023-05,,0142-9612,1878-5905,10.1016/j.biomaterials.2023.122092,36965281,PMC10111969,,"Biomedical Engineering Department, Tissue Engineering Resource Center, Tufts University, Medford, MA, USA.

Possibly, in time, the curiosity to apply this technology towards human meat production will emerge. However, when presented with the thought of eating cultured human meat potential consumers’ reaction greatly varies from pure disgust to indifference to excitement. This instinctive response indicates a lack of preformed judgements towards the topic. Without a clear vision on the possibility of cultured human meat, scattered and uncertain regulations will fail to uphold paramount moral values. The risk is that we would either dig into this option out of excitement, or ban it without convincing motivations. The ethical theories of deontology and consequentialism can be followed to investigate this divisive issue. With an evaluation based on disgust I argue that the deontological perspective is mostly concerned with values of identity and humanness, while with a chain-reaction reasoning I argue that consequentialism would be concerned with health safety, privacy and equality. I conclude that cultured human meat is not acceptable.",,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2023,8,1,9,Food Ethics,,2023-03-31,,2364-6861,,10.1007/s41055-023-00121-x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023-04-28,2023-05-05

This will create an unprecedented boom in the demand for animal products over the coming years which will need to be managed properly. Industry stakeholders worldwide have been touting the potential benefits of “artificial meat” in recent years as a more sustainable way of producing animal protein. “Artificial meat” is therefore moving into the global spotlight and this study aimed to investigate how African meat consumers of the coming generations perceive it, i.e., the urban, more educated and younger consumers. Three surveys were conducted with more than 12,000 respondents in total. The respondents came from 12 different countries (Cameroon, Congo, -DRC Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria, Senegal South Africa, Tanzania and Tunisia). Respondents in this survey prefered the term “artificial meat”. This term was therefore used throughout the survey. “Artificial meat” proved to be fairly well known in the surveyed countries as about 64% the respondents had already heard of “artificial meat.” Only 8.9% were definitely willing to try “artificial meat” (score of 5 on a scale of 1–5) mostly males between 31 and 50 years of age. Furthermore, 31.2% strongly agreed that “artificial meat” will have a negative impact on the rural life (score of 5 on a scale of 1–5) and 32.9% were not prepared to accept “artificial meat” as a viable alternative in the future but were still prepared to eat meat alternatives. Of all the results, we observed significant differences in responses between respondents’ countries of origin, age and education level with interactions between these factors for willingness to try. For instance, the richest and most educated countries that were surveyed tended to be more willing to try “artificial meat.” A similar pattern was observed for willingness to pay, except that gender had no significant effect and age had only a small effect. One major observation is that a large majority of respondents are not willing to pay more for “artificial meat” than for meat from livestock.",,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2023,,,,,unknown,2023-04-15,,,,10.3389/fnut.2023.1127655,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023-04-28,2023-05-05

Such a transition is only possible if consumers are willing to accept foods produced using novel technologies. Previous research on consumer acceptance has generally focused on individual technologies in isolation, rendering comparisons across studies difficult, and mostly considered average acceptance without devoting attention to individual differences among consumers. Additionally, available data overwhelmingly pertained to European and North American consumers, whereas much less is known about consumer perception in non-Western countries. Against this backdrop, this study examined consumer acceptance and perception of a wide range of novel, sustainable food technologies in four countries (Australia, India, Singapore, and the USA, N = 2494 in total) using survey methodology. For each technology, willingness-to-consume (WTC, operationalized as expected frequency of consumption), emotional associations, and situational appropriateness responses were collected. All measures revealed major differences in consumer perception of novel food technologies, identifying three groups: 1) technologies with high consumer acceptance comprising vegetables from urban farming and vegetables packaged in a modified atmosphere; 2) technologies with medium consumer acceptance comprising fish reared in aquaponics systems, plant-based alternatives to meat and dairy, and gene-editing; 3) technologies with low consumer acceptance comprising insect ingredients, cell-cultured meat and cell-cultured fish. Technologies in the high acceptance group were perceived as healthier and apt to move one's diet in a more sustainable direction, whereas consumers had issues associating specific benefits to the less accepted technologies. Cross-cultural differences were identified. Most notably, Indian consumers responded more positively to all novel food technologies, especially compared to consumers in the US and Australia. Finally, four pan-national consumer segments were identified based on their overall patterns of acceptance towards novel food technologies. The segments varied primarily in terms of baseline WTC (low, medium, and high), indicating that consumers tended to accept or reject novel food technologies regardless of their nature. The segment characterized by a high acceptance included only about a fifth of the consumers, showing that WTC towards novel food technologies for most consumers ranged from moderate to outright rejection. Collectively, the findings of this study suggest that consumers' general skepticism regarding technologies in the food domain remains a significant challenge towards achieving more sustainable diets.",Cross-cultural consumer research; Food technology neophobia; Novel food technologies; Sustainable food systems; Technology adoption,Cultivated Meat Library,,,,,,2023,408,,137119,J.
